Website of Brian Williams
-------------------------

This website was built by my dad, Jim Nagel.
After he died we asked Brian what he wanted to do with his website,
and he said it was okay to let it disappear.
I thought that was a shame since my dad spent a lot of time on it,
so decided to deploy it somewhere free.
Its domain used to be `brianwilliams.org.uk`,
and now it's hosted on Netlify at [https://brianwilliams.netlify.app/][].

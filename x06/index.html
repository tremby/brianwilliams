For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given:<BR>
and the government shall be upon his shoulder:<BR>
and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God,<BR>
The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.<BR>
<I>Isaiah 9:6</I><br>
<br>
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,<BR>
and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is,<BR>
God with us.<BR>
<I>Matthew 1:23</I><br>
<br>
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS:<BR>
for he shall save his people from their sins.<BR>
<I>Matthew 1:21</I>

The photos were taken at East Wittering on 2nd July 1964 and in Cyprus
(Paphos) in February this year when we joined Clarice, Julia and Malcolm for
an unexpected week‘s holiday. Five and a half years after
&ldquo;retiring&rdquo; we are busy as ever. I still work up to 16 hours most
days but we have a nap in the afternoon as often as not. Freda&rsquo;s
embroidery class meets here on Monday mornings, the Bible study (now in its
47th year) on Friday afternoons fortnightly.<p>

We both enjoy reading (chiefly biography and history), walking, gardening,
nature study and music. We sang with Millfield Festival Chorus in a notable
<I>Messiah</I> at Wells Cathedral, and with Strode Music Theatre Society in
four Spring concerts (four more this month D.V.). Another great interest is
railways! All nostalgia! The website Diary now contains multiple entries for
every year of my life&mdash;I am concentrating now on the War in
Birmingham.<p>

It has been a great joy to renew fellowship with the Rev. Peter Scothern,
best man at our wedding on 20th June 1959. Then on 29th October, All
Souls/All Saints, our dear brother Arthur Gordon Paul Williams, whose life
was terminated in the womb on 7th July 1944, was specially remembered in
beautiful services at St Benedict&rsquo;s and St John&rsquo;s here in
Glastonbury, and also at St Mary&rsquo;s, Acocks Green, where he would have
been christened. He is now part of the family.<p>

<center>Thank you for your love and prayers. We love you!<p>

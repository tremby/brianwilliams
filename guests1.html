Hello Brian, Fascinating reading!<p>
I lived from 1941 to 1960 in Oakhurst Rd (the other side of Fox Hollies Park to you. I attended Yardley Grammar School and was also a member of the Boy`s Brigade next to the Methodist church in Botteville. The walks that you mention and also the radio and television programmes of long ago bring back many happy memories. I met my wife at the Olton cinema and we have now been married for 46 years.<p>
We have recently returned to live in Solihull and so have returned almost to our roots.<p><hr>

Hello Brian<p>

It was fascinating reading the part of your diary I've so far managed.<p>

I was at KES from 1944 to 1950, and remember a lot of the masters you mention. I started at the end of headmaster England's sojourn. He used to stand straight-faced in his black gown facing us while we jubilantly sang "Where the iron heart of England throbs beneath its sombre robe ...".

brian: rowing aimlessly through these sites recently i came across your diary and realised my life and times in birmingham ran paralel with yours from 1940 through to 1950.<p>
 i was a billesley lad who took the billesley school to sparkhill commercial route interlinking with those magic blues days and the schoolboy bottle cricket matches at the County Ground.  The bombs, the luftwaffe drones, the shrapnel, eric hollies, ambrose mulraney, gil merrick, huge crowds for the matches, the struggles through the snow to get to school or find the milk or coalman, the British Restaurants (never got the spelling right!), Yardley Wood Road, the 24 bus, School Road Moseley, playing Hartfield Road School .... past days providing current nostalgia...<p>
Also, it obvious we lived Birmingham City F.C:  your memories are my memories to the last goal, including Gil's save from the Dougie Reid penalty at snow bound St Andrews and those Neil Dougal crossbar wallops.<p>
But the paralels in those blakc and white days do not stop there:  the reason i was trawling the web that night was to do a little geneological explorations which the same day had taken me to the house occupied by a relation c1890.... in Baldwins Lane (No 67)!  You were bombed out at a time i was staying in Charles Road, Small Heath, on the night you must have  been hit, the night they dropped a super landmine in Whitehall Road and I think the B.S.A. "got it."
<p>Thank you, Brian, for your jottings between comic swapping no doubt.  john.<p><hr><!--SPAM

I found your site while doing research into variety acts appearing at the Hippodrome Wolverhampton 1921 -'56 ! I have really enjoyed reading your diary extracts and look forward to using them in my work as a Literacy teacher, alongside Anne Frank and William Cobbett. Good company - but what a mixture !!<p>

Best wishes for a happy future.<p><hr>

Your website is refreshing and reafirming of what the WWW was/is supposed to be. I found your site by searching Google for stories about the 1953 Coronation of Queen Elizabeth. I have only vague memories of the event (although I remember watching it on tv as well) when I was 6 years old in Grangemouth Scotland. Only one person on our street had a tv set so it was a very crowded living room indeed!<p>


Thank you very much for the wonderful story!<p><hr>

A friend of mine gave me details of your web-site after discovering it in the magazine published for St. Mary's church at Acocks Green. <p>
I understand you lived in Circular Road from 1941 onwards. I lived at 16 Central Grove from about 1934 until I married in 1953. I had friends that lived in Circular Road and in particular Ken Martin who also attended King Edwards Camp Hill grammar school from 1941 to 1946. I went to Yardley Grammar school in Tyseley during that same period.<p>
I have taken a quick tour through your diary and will study it more thoroughly when I get more time. Regards,

Arthur Page<p><hr>

Dear Brian, what a delight to discover your site as I was searching for some traces of my distant family. I was born in Solihull, in 1941 and emigrated to the U.S in 1965. I went to St Phillip's Grammar school in Edgbaston and The Oratory was my church. <p>

I enjoyed your stories about the "Blues" (I'm a 'Villa fan!), your preaching and the ministry. I applaud you for these memoirs and the discipline it takes to maintain them...wish I'd done the same because we all have a book inside us? God bless. Tom Luton, Bettendorf,Iowa<p><hr>

This is delightful.  I grew up in Hall Green, and went up to KES in 1961.  I remember many of the masters you mention, although we added many nicknames; "Ollie" Matthews, "Billy" Buttle, "Coco" Copeland and "Fred" Kay to mention but a few!  I also knew John Maund when he was, among other things, running the "70 Club" in Birmingham.  Thank you.

Hi Brian, I trust your visit to Palma (If I remember rightly!) was a good trip?

I met you yesterday morning at the airport at around 0600.  Your site is very interesting, I have enjoyed browsing through the pages of your life!

Hope all goes well for you in your future adventures!

Very impressive.  Hope I haven't said this here before but there is much admiration for your diaries within the message forum of www.whirligig.tv where I am the moderator.    The site is devoted to 50s tv and radio and the forum covers tv, radio, theatre, literature, music, films, etc.   Take a look!
thanks,

<P> A friend of mine as a collection of
  very old photographs which she was going to throw away, i have asked her to
  keep them and wondered if Alton Douglas or Carl Chinn would like them. they
  are of mixed content, but all in the Birmingham area. </p>

<P>Hi Brian</p>
<P>This is cracking social
history. Have you contacted Patrick Baird, Head of Local Studies and
History at Birmingham Central Library? I think he should know about the
site. I now bring out a monthly magazine called <I>Carl Chinn's Brummagem</I>.
Would you fancy doing a write-up about your website with its address etc?
Be glad to receive it and include it in a future edition.</p>
<p>Best Wishes,<BR>

<p> Brian,<br>
<P>It was great to meet you and other old friends on Sunday.  The girls and boys
did a great concert in the evening, with excerpts from their shows.</P>
<p>Neil, John and I went round the school and were locked in!   We got out
eventually, having walked down all the forbidden corridors!</p>

<P>We met others later -- one, name not given, mentioned a book by Jonathan Coe,
which uses School life under the name of King Williams -- I have look in
Amazon and think it must be 'The Rotters' Club' -- have you read it?</p>

<P>Have looked at your dairy -- what a mammoth effort -- I can only admire your
self-discipline.</p>

<P>All the best to Freda and yourself. Alf</p>

<P>Dear Brian</p>

<p>I have just been reading the diary of that earnest young lad that was your
former self. It was another world and all but had me in tears.</p>

<P>I wasn't a contemporary of yours as my years at KES would have been 1951-58
(I think). But I too was in UMD (which I think was for the more "remedial"
types who weren't going to make it to Oxbridge) and Mr Parry was my form
teacher then too. I recall he got a lot of kudos from having some sort of
Welsh Rugby experience and seemed to take a firm though fatherly line with
some of the rougher elements that had gravitated to UMD. Of the names you
mention I think I remember Mendelssohn as he was the 6th former in charge of
the Jewish boys who didn't attend prayers in Big School.</p>

<p>I too was from your neck of the woods in Birmingham and used to catch the
Special Bus that started at Acocks Green on those occasions when the weather
was too bad to cycle. I attended York House School prior to KES which was
near the corner of School Road and Fox Hollies Rd. I picked it up from
Springfield Road and do recall the Springfield cinema which I think became a
car showroom later on (I was an ABC minor at the Robin Hood which was also
on Stratford Road, near the end of Fox Hollies Rd).</p>

<p>I didn't realise the school was doing anything special for 450 years -- I've
still got the <I>Quadringentos iam per annos ....</I> book somewhere that marked
400.</p>

<p>All the best and I look forward to future instalments.</p>

<p><b>From <FONT CLASS=link>Annie Murray</FONT> in Reading on 26 May 2002</b></p>

<P>Dear Brian,</p>

<P>What a prolific writer you are! I admire anyone who has the discipline to
keep diaries as they get older. I used to do it a lot as a child but find it
difficult to keep up now. From a quick brows (so far) your diaries seem very
rich in just the sort of detail which so easily gets lost and would also be
of great value to me. In fact the next book I am currently preparing to
write will probably be set from about 1946-50 or so. So thank you very much
for that.</P>

<P>How many books? Well -- the Birmingham ones, there are now seven. The last
of these, [<i>Chocolate Girls</i>], which is set round Cadburys in Bournville is
due out next March. The others are probably listed in the books you have,
but just in case: <i>Birmingham Rose</i>, <i>Birmingham Friends</i> (also titled <i>Kate and
Olivia</i>), <i>Birmingham Blitz</i>, <i>Orphan of Angel Street</i>, <i>Poppy Day</i> and
<i>The Narrowboat Girl</i>.</p>

<p>With all good wishes.</p>

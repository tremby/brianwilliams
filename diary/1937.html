<H2>Something behind the wardrobe</H2>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There is something behind the wardrobe in the room where I sleep. I am very frightened and do not want to go to bed. Daddy has put a little lamp by my bed. He lights it and turns the wick up. It makes a funny smell. Daddy sings a luller by, but there is something behind the wardrobe.</P>

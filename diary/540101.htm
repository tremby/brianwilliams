<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>FRIDAY 1st JANUARY 1954</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Another Diary goes into the
bookcase – this is my seventh [big one, my twelfth in all].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Our New Year’s Eve social was
quite enjoyable. It was held in the big hall and there were about seventy of us
altogether. It lasted until about 11.0 and afterwards Helen and I went to a
Watchnight Service conducted by Mr. Dibben. It was the first that either of us
had ever been to one and Helen had never before let in the New Year. Afterwards
we stood talking outside her house. I went to bed at </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>1.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            In the morning Helen and I went
walking to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Solihull</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Shirley
and Hall Green along the usual route, down </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stratford
  Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Reddings Lane</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, along </span><span lang=EN-GB>Shaftmoor Lane</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Cateswell Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>
and so to Tyseley. Last night was the coldest of the winter and there was a
hard frost which left the countryside under a shroud of white.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mam and Clarice and Julia were
out when I got home. I listened to the first of a new series of <i>Film Time</i>,
then fetched Ginger a sack of straw.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I went to Club as
usual. We had a games evening and there was also a play read-through in which I
didn’t take part because I was doing my own pantomime at the time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>SATURDAY 2nd JANUARY</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Today was my last free Saturday
before I start work at the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Medical</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>School</span><span lang=EN-GB> on Monday. It
was a foggy day. I went to Dorling’s and paid for the papers, 4/2d for the last
two weeks. I took Helen to the New Year Social tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>SUNDAY 3rd JANUARY</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            As last Sunday evening, we had
Rev. T. Leslie Thexton to conduct this morning’s service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I spent the afternoon tidying
up some of my books and finding out one or two things I shall need tomorrow. I
also completed my weather readings for 1953 and I am now discontinuing the
practice after seven years. With even less time than usual at my disposal, I
can’t afford to keep it up. Anyway, December 1953’s readings were on the last
page of my duplicate book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight’s service was a
Covenant Service and included Communion. It lasted until 8.15 and afterwards
Helen and I went to the Fellowship where we had a half-hour of cards. It seems
rather strange after Christmas but it isn’t twelfth night until January 6th.</span></p>

<p class=topic><span lang=EN-GB>Medical</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>School</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            For the last seven months or
more, </span><span lang=EN-GB>January 4th 1954</span><span lang=EN-GB> had been
just a significant date in the future. After one day at the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Medical</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>School</span><span
lang=EN-GB> I can’t quite remember what I expected it to be like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I caught the 8.26 ’bus [the 1A
to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bristol Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> and then the ’bus
to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Edgbaston Park Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>, exactly
as I have done for the last 6½ years nearly] and arrived at exactly nine. The
Pharmacology department is part of the West Wing: this also houses Experimental
Psychiatry, the Library, P [space left and a blank line here].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            John Winrow came in at 9.30 and
proceeded to show me around. We have two labs opposite each other, numbered
CG15 and 23. All the corridors are lettered according to whether they are in
the East or West wings, or centrally placed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            There are two other new
assistants, Dennis Vaughan and Jenny, but they are not in my department. The
three of us went up to Dr. Sammons’ room where we got a pink card filled in, then
went across to the University to Mr. Burton’s office to hand this in together
with Insurance Cards. We were given copies of the Regulations and it appears I
have to resign at 65.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Back again at M.S., John
introduced me to the members of the Department. In our own labs there are Rory
Finnegan, Roy Bentley and my immediate “boss” Dr. W.F.R. Pover. Dr. Pover is not
very old, is married and has an assistant. My job is essentially
Radio-chemistry which is something I’m interested in but don’t know much about</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Actually I have
John’s job as he is going to the Chemistry department in a fortnight’s time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The right hand lab contains a dark-room
for photography, a weighing room, and a “counting” room. This latter contains
three Geiger-counters which John showed me how to operate. Above these rooms is
a loft in which we can only just sit down. Here there are cupboards in which
are kept the more dangerous radioactive materials. There is also a table and a
type-writer which is going to be jolly useful …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            During the day John showed me
the cold room, workshop, animal houses (cats, dogs, mice, rats, guinea-pigs),
canteen, library and numerous other places which I’ve forgotten already.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>TUESDAY 5th JANUARY</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was at </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Medical</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>School</span><span
lang=EN-GB> on the stroke of nine this morning. By all accounts, most people
roll in around </span><span lang=EN-GB>ten o’clock</span><span lang=EN-GB> in
the morning. The first work I did this morning was to take a break for tea at </span><span lang=EN-GB>10.15am</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Dr. Pover only just then came in. I
spent the hour or so in between “up aloft” typing a page of my book, and
managed to do so with only three or four mistakes. I shalln’t need that Private
Secretary I’d been thinking about…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I’m gradually learning my way
about the place, though it will be months before I shall be able to get into
the hospital and find my own way out. It would look rather silly for me to be
wearing my white coat and having to ask the direction. School was pretty
confusing but the [Queen Elizabeth] Hospital is miles worse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=dateChar><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt'>WEDNESDAY
6th JANUARY</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            No one came in this morning
until nearly ten so I was able to put in an hour’s work on the type-writer. I
typed out several pages of my pantomime, part of the middle actually, as I
haven’t decided on the ending yet, and only wrote the beginning this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            There was nothing to do before
morning break; afterwards we had to do several counts on the faeces and urine
of a patient in the Children’s Hospital, and John showed me how to work out the
results. We continued this in the afternoon, then after tea helped Dr. Pover to
clear out some cupboards and re-stock them. I came out at </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.50pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. It snowed throughout the day at intervals
and there was a fine covering as I came home. It was very cold last night, the
temperature fell to 28 degrees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>THURSDAY 7th JANUARY</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got more of my pantomime
typed this morning. I am calling it “Crazy Nights With King Arthur”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We had a frost again last
night. Today has been mainly fine and sunny but very cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>FRIDAY 8th JANUARY</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had to go to College this
morning [the </span><span lang=EN-GB>College</span><span lang=EN-GB> of </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Technology</span><span lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Suffolk
  Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>] from 9.0 until </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>12.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> for a Zoology class. My lecturer
was Miss K.S. Richards, the first woman teacher I’ve had since July 1946. The
lecture was on the mammalian skull, then after a tea-break we drew the skull of
a dog for practical work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got back to work just after </span><span lang=EN-GB>one o’clock</span><span lang=EN-GB> and in the afternoon collected my
first week’s wages – £3 3s 3d. From my £3 10s 0d had been deducted 5/9d Insurance
and 1/-d Income Tax.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to Club as usual. We had
a dancing evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>SATURDAY 9th JANUARY</span></p>

<p class=topic><span lang=EN-GB>Blues win at Molineux</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            There was an overnight thaw and
everywhere was damp this morning. My work this morning consisted of filing some
apparatus cards and typing a list of electrical apparatus that we keep in the
loft. I finished at 12.30 and got home for </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>1.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> in the middle of the heavy downpour
of rain that had been threatening all morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I almost decided to go to see
Blues’ [</span><span lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>City</span><span lang=EN-GB>] 3rd Round Cup match at Molineux but
changed my mind last night. I was absolutely certain Blues would win even
though Wolves are top of Div. I. I told Dad this afternoon that Wolves would
score in the first ten minutes, then Blues would score twice. Actually Wilshaw
scored in the 13th minute, Murphy equalised, and Rowley scored the winner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span></b><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I took Helen to the
Piccadilly to see Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in <i>The Caddy </i>and <i>Farewell
Mr. Grock</i> (Grock the clown).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning the preacher was
the vicar [minister, the Revd. J. Valentine Dibben] and one of the things he
talked about was “Why should it happen to me?” Actually the subject was Christ’s
power of forgiving sins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight the Rev A.R. Spencer
spoke on the Lord’s Prayer. I don’t know whether he chose the hymns, though. I
suspect that he did, but we knew hardly any of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Afterwards at Y.P.F., Rev.
Clifford Hind spoke on “Prisons”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            A third B.O.A.C Comet has
crashed in the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Mediterranean</span><span lang=EN-GB>

There were only six of us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Dr. Pover came back this

home at </span><span lang=EN-GB>midday</span><span lang=EN-GB> having done
nothing at all during the morning save some Biology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            When I went to pay my fee at
College this afternoon, it had gone up to 18/-d but I soon got it put back to
14/6d. The people in the office don’t seem to know much about their job at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            On enrolment, one automatically

These embrace sporting activities and others ranging from Botany, Conservation,
Industrial Administration, Jazz, to Metallurgy, Motor Cycling, Paint and
Varnish, and Pharmacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The College has 8,500 students,
more than 5,000 of them adults. Parts of the College are transferring to the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I came out of work early today
as Dad was taking us all to the pantomime Humpty Dumpty at the [Theatre] Royal.
It was a lovely evening. I have seen only one other pantomime, in January 1945
(Tessie O’Shea in <i>Red Riding Hood</i>) but I can well believe that this is </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span lang=EN-GB>’s finest Christmas show for
many years. Norman Evans was outstanding as the dame. He did his “over the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            When Mr. Haywood came to see
our Youth Club in December, he asked me to write an article for <i>Youth</i>. I
finally got round to completing it today and typed it at work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            As usual, the business of
re-organising was continued today. The irritating thing is that after nearly
two weeks’ work, the lab still looks as untidy as ever. I felt unusually
depressed for the greater part of the day, and a rather cutting remark I made
to Margaret didn’t improve matters. I didn’t know whether she was going to
burst into flames or tears but I think she would have liked to kill me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>             I was ten minutes late for
College this morning. First the ’bus did a creep, went the long way round and
took me right into New Street because the Hill Street lights were wrong, and,
already five minutes late, I was further delayed when I met David Torvell
outside the Post Office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At college we studied mammalian
dentition and drew the teeth of dog, cat, horse and sheep. Miss Richards also
gave us each a “name this bone” oral test in which I got 85% from ten questions
on the skull.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I called in at school on my way
back to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Medical</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>School</span><span lang=EN-GB> and secured a <i>King Edward’s
School Chronicle</i> for myself. It was a funny sensation being at school but
not belonging …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The tedious job of shifting
things about in the lab continues. One other job John and I had to do was to
bathe the eyes of Blackie which are in a very bad way. The vet has been in and
prescribed Sodium Sulphacetamide which we got from the dispensary in the
hospital. I think I shall one day be able to find my way around the hospital by
the colours of the different corridors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            In the evening I went as usual
to the Club. It was to have been a games evening but our room had been taken
for a party that Clarice and Julia attended, so we were rather disorganised.
First, I took part in a play-reading in the Secretary’s room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was very windy today, a real
gale.</span></p>

CinemaScope</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to work on the s.b. this
morning and got in at 9.10. I typed a page and a half of my pantomime – the
first work I’ve done on it this week – and spent the remainder of the morning
arranging bottles and putting screws into one of the Dessian tables Rory is
making.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight Helen and I went to see
the first film in CinemaScope at the Odeon. It was <i>The Robe</i>, taken from
the novel by Lloyd C. Douglas. It had its preview on Monday. There was, of
course, a very long queue. We joined it at 5.55 and within five minutes there
were another 100-150 people behind us. We had to wait two hours. The film
started at 8.25 and lasted 139 minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I found the film so outstanding
that the wide-screen seemed only a secondary consideration. It was extremely
moving at times and very tenderly acted by a first-rate cast. I suppose that a
fault of most Biblical films is that the subject is not treated with the
respect it requires, but here there was no lack of sincerity or dignity and the
film is so well done that [unfinished]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I’ve been busy all day today.
During the morning Dr. Pover helped me to complete the screwing down of the
tables, then we moved them into the dark room. John moved to the Chemistry
department today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Sandy, who is usually in charge
of the animals, got married on Saturday, so we’ve got the job of looking after
the cats all this week. I spent the whole afternoon cleaning out our cats and
bathing Blackie’s eyes. Mrs. R has a bad eye as well so she required some
special attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Dr. Pover took me to town in
his car this evening. At College, Mr. Hindle dealt with Spirogyra. This [Botany]
class seems to be a dead loss so far as we are concerned. Only six out of 18
were present tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The new 3d, 6d and 7d stamps
came out today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The morning post brought me a
letter from the Income Tax people who wanted to know where I was employed
between April and the date of commencement with the University. I suppose they
meant 1953. They also wanted to know what my wife earns, and what tips I pick
up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At work, I bathed Blackie’s
eyes twice and Mrs. R’s once. I also made up a new Sulphacetamide solution and
made some printed slips for some loose-leaf books.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At College, we carried on with

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Apart from counting specimens
nothing much happened at work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At Club tonight we had a games

cats. Being soft-hearted I let Twinks out of her cage and then couldn’t catch
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I cycled to Blues’ match v </span><span

They are now 2nd in the League, a point behind Everton, and sharing the same
number of points as five other clubs. Some race, but Blues could get promotion
and the Cup this year. Mr. W.H. Grady died at </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was a really beautiful

me this evening and to the Fellowship afterwards. I think he really enjoyed
himself. We had a Balloon Game evening. Margaret Hibberd was Nurse Cavell, Len
Boden was Alexander Graham Bell, and Frank Davis was Dr. Albert Schweitzer. We
threw out Bell (35 votes), while nineteen of us would have ditched Nurse
Cavell. Dr. Schweitzer was unanimously retained.</span></p>

hard-board and I am fixing them in position with ½ inch square wood cut to the
required lengths.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I spent an hour weighing the cats
during the morning. Blackie has recovered from his operation but can see very
little. I had him out of his cage and walked him round, which seemed to restore
some of his confidence – he even climbed onto a box. During the afternoon I had
to show a visitor Asym the Crétin, and some of the other cats</span></p>

I awoke this morning was that I had forgotten to mention my visit to see
Carroll Levis at the Windsor Theatre, Bearwood in my Diary last June! I got out

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The most interesting part of
work today was making a movie film of the cats. Dr. Pover got a cine-camera and
fitted up half-a-dozen arc lamps; the main difficulty came when we wanted the
animals to return. We filmed each separately, trying to get them all to walk
along the bench. It wasn’t easy because the cats were rather curious or
frightened by the strong lighting or the whirr of the camera.</span></p>

meeting. As things turned out, I didn’t go to the meeting after all, didn’t
leave until 1.15, because I wanted to finish partitioning the drawer – the job
I started on Monday. Even so, it’s still not finished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            John Maund and I were on the
same 1A ’bus this morning. We hadn’t seen each other for a few weeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was nearly all “office” work
for me today. One of my jobs was to graph the cats’ weights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The new Bristol Britannia
airliner [G-ALRX, the second prototype] has crashed on a test flight in the
Severn Estuary. The pilot Bill Pegg made an emergency landing on the mud flats,
and everyone on board escaped, but the plane will now be covered by the tide. It
flew for the first time only six weeks ago on 23rd December.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:16.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<div style='border:none;border-right:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0cm 12.0pt 0cm 0cm'>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>G-ALRX took off from Filton with Captain
A.J. (‘Bill’) Pegg at the controls, Ken Fitzgerald and Gareth Jones, Flight
Engineers, G. Malouin of KLM, co-pilot, and nine others. Seven minutes later starboard
engine No. 3 began heating up and was switched off. Having cooled sufficiently
it was switched back on again and the flight continued northward. On climbing
through 10,000 feet the engine heated up again and suddenly exploded, shrapnel
piercing the oil tank and setting the engine on fire.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            As a precaution No. 4 engine
was shut off, but then the portside 1 and 2 engines shut down (due to a short
circuit caused by the fire) leaving the Britannia without power. The engineers
managed to start them up again, but with the starboard wing engulfed in flames
and the fuel tanks threatening to explode at any moment, Bill Pegg turned the aircraft
round and, with its wheels and flaps up, made a belly-landing on the mudflats
of the Severn estuary, not far from Littleton-on-Severn. The tide being out,
the Britannia careered along for 400 yards, gouging five tracks in the mud
before veering right and coming to rest facing out from the shore.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            Shaken, but otherwise unhurt
(except for a minor head injury suffered by the radio-operator), the crew and
passengers jumped out. Local people and workers from the nearby brick works
rushed to their aid, and fire tenders were soon on the spot but were not
required as the mud had extinguished the fire. A mesh pathway was laid over the
mud enabling equipment to be retrieved, but the aircraft was unable to be
pulled ashore until two days later, and having been submerged in the sea it was
a write-off.            </span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            This accident to G-ALRX
(caused by sheared-off teeth from a pinion at the front of the propeller shaft
and consequent over-speeding of the Proteus 705 turboprop engine), together
with the grounding of the first prototype G-ALBO (due to a flap-failure on one
of its test flights), delayed production of the Britannia, but it subsequently
became a highly successful airliner with B.O.A.C. and the Royal Air Force. (Freda
and I flew in them many times.)</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            Beyond repair, G-ALRX was
returned to Filton in sections, the main fuselage etc. used for instruction,
and the rear for torsion and fatigue tests. The refurbished nose section
provided flight deck training for some 6,000 aircrew until 1971 when it was
moved to RAF Brize Norton. It was subsequently donated to the Britannia
Aircraft Preservation Trust (a Registered Charity) and housed briefly at
Banwell before finding a more permanent home at Kemble where it is on display
to the public. I am indebted to the Trust for the dramatic photograph. [jpg] </span></p>

<p class=topic><span lang=EN-GB>Back pain</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At College this morning we did
a 3½ hour dissection of the rabbit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Back at M.S. I had a very
severe attack of backache which had me rolling on the floor in agony. Dr. Pover
got Dr. French who wrote a note and sent me to the Casualty Department. The
doctor there tested my reflexes and examined my legs to make sure I still had
all the feeling in them, and asked several alarming questions. I had three
X-rays taken but until Monday at 9.30 all I know is that I haven’t a slipped
disc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            By the time they had finished
with me it was about 5.0. The pain had eased a little by </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> so I went to Club so as not to disappoint
Helen who was not going to Choir Practice. It was a dancing evening and did me
more good than harm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Altogether it’s been rather a
relaxing day. I didn’t get up until nearly </span><span lang=EN-GB>midday</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and my backache had gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>4.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> I went to tea with Helen, a very nice
tea too, then in the evening we went to the Gaumont to see the second
CinemaScope production <i>How to Marry a Millionaire</i> (U) starring Marilyn
Monroe, Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall. It was an excellent comedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The preacher this morning was
Rev. E. Bryan Harvey, B.A., B.Sc., the minister for Ward End.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben preached tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            My X-rays showed nothing but
bones, and the doctor’s verdict was “severe fibrositis”, which was a relief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was comparatively warm this
morning and the falling sleet made the roads slushy. It was a delight to watch
the expressions on the faces of four or five people who saw one student perform
rigorous contortions and just manage to keep on his feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            A letter from 22945990 Gnr.
Chadwin tells me he is a T.A.R.A. and that he stands behind guns with a
slide-rule, that the WRACs and NAAFI girls run a profitable business on the
side, and that the females at Oswestry are ’orrible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Nothing much happened at work.
We studied Mucor at College.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The new Queen Elizabeth II 9d,

today. At College we studied the histology of the gut.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had to go to Club this
evening for a play read-through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was dull and foggy and cold
all day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to work on the S.B. this
morning. I spent the morning and afternoon counting. During our lunch-break
John and I discussed plans for a proposed trip to </span><span lang=EN-GB>France</span><span
lang=EN-GB> in two months’ time. It would be of about ten days duration, April
4th-24th.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Our department’s seminar was
cancelled so I went to one held by the Department of Physiology in the Dental
Theatre. It was on “The clearance of particles from the blood stream.
Radio-active microsphere (caesium glass) of size 2.5 [mu] were injected into
rats. Half-clearance was effected in one minute, and it was found that 70-80%
of the particles were taken up by the liver. This phagocytosis is due to some
adhesive mechanism, but some particles, e.g. red cells, escape it, no one knows
why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Being rather tired I went to
bed at 9.0 last night and listened in to <i>The Unguarded Hour</i> by Bernard
Merrivale. Malcolm Keen played Sir Francis Deardon, Q.C. It is an excellent
play which I had heard previous to last night’s production. It might make a
good film.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At College this morning we
continued with the Arterial and Venous Systems and did more work on our
rabbits. Mine has become rather a mess.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I met David Torvell in the Post
Office [G.P.O., </span><span lang=EN-GB>Victoria Square</span><span lang=EN-GB>]
and wrote some Valentines for him. I met John outside the [Theatre] Royal, as
we had previously arranged. We went to Cook’s and to New Street Station to make
enquiries about travelling to </span><span lang=EN-GB>France</span><span
lang=EN-GB> [and got some brochures. jpg]. We also went to the Record Shop
below Woodhouse’s [furniture shop].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At work one of my jobs was to
wash a consignment of bottles (48) which we got from Phillip Harris’s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We played games at Club
tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I began counting
samples from a Mr. John Comerford in the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Queen</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Elizabeth</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I have shown Rory how to do the
counting and he was able to do half of it while I got on with some other work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen came to tea at </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. We sat in the front room looking at my
picture postcards. After this we went to the Olton to see Norman Wisdom’s first
film <i>Trouble in Store</i>. (It was at the </span><span lang=EN-GB>West End</span><span
lang=EN-GB> last week). An unpretentious film with no plot, just a series of
acts by Norman Wisdom, it achieved a very good standard of entertainment, and
given the right material there is every reason to believe that here is a new
star in the tradition of Chaplin and Lloyd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The supporting film was a crime
thriller <i>The Glass Web</i> with Edward G. Robinson and Kathleen Hughes. It
was also very good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben was the preacher at
this morning’s service, and tonight we had Rev. Arnold B. Jones. Mr. Jones’
sermon was especially good – one could have heard a pin drop and the ticking of
wrist-watches sounded as loud as the Geiger-counter at work!</span></p>

this morning saying I cannot be deferred. I don’t know what happens now but Dr.

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At work I worked out the
results obtained with our </span><span lang=EN-GB>Q.E.</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> patient, and did one or two other

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The whole of my college class
was devoted to practical work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen’s half-term ends tomorrow
night and I wanted to take her out this evening but there was nowhere to go, so
I was invited to spend the evening with the Walkers. We played Canasta and a
word-game, and altogether it was a most relaxing evening. Afterwards Helen came
round to see <i>The Name’s the Same</i>, and a C.B.S. programme <i>Person to
Person</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The seminar was given by Dr.
J.W. Daniel, the subject being “Some Aspects of Fat Absorption”. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I did not leave work until

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At Club tonight there was a
table-tennis match v. Holy Souls R.C. Youth Club. The match was drawn 6-6. Some
of us watched the match, the rest of us listened to gramophone records we each
took along. (I took Al Jolson’s <i>I’m in Seventh Heaven</i>. I did the washing
up. The second part of the evening took the form of dancing, after which I gave
out a notice concerning a Youth Club broadcast I want to put on.</span></p>

from this unpleasant shock it was a beautiful day, the sun shining all day long,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I took Helen to the
Waldorf to see <i>Abbott and Costello Go To Mars</i> in which they accidentally
launch a space-ship with an escaped gangster on board. It was quite funny. The other
film <i>City Beneath the Sea</i> was also enjoyable, especially for the
colourful locations and underwater photography. It was about deep-sea divers

I finished early and came home at 5.05 but even so, it took me just over an

At the Youth Fellowship I was first speaker in the in the debate “This house
thinks that a Christian should not take up arms.” Len Boden seconded me, Brian
Brennan and Bernard Greatrex opposed. Voting was about 18-10 against, with
quite a number of abstentions. One of the abstainers was a “mugwump”, I said,
“sitting on the fence with his mug on one side and his wump on the other,”
which brought the house down. [Pat Welch described it as a “rumbustious
debate”.]</span></p>

she came home at </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> having

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to the Library this
afternoon and got out <i>Inspector West Kicks Off</i> (John Creasey), <i>The
Kon-Tiki Expedition</i> by Thor Heyerdahl and <i>Our Neighbour Worlds</i> by

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I took Helen to see
Damon Runyan’s <i>Money From Home</i> at the Gaumont, starring Dean Martin

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Today has been our Church
Anniversary and the preacher at both our services was the Rev Dr. Eric W.
Baker, Secretary of the Methodist Conference. The subject this morning was “Be
ye therefore perfect” (Matthew 5:48), and the choices a Christian has to make –
the straightforward good v. bad; the difficult “lesser of two evils” choice;
and the most important of all, the choice between the good and the best.</span></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal'>            Mam
and Dad came to this evening’s service. At Y.P.F. I led the devotions. We had
Hymn 821 <i>Stand up, stand up for Jesus!</i>; prayers, including a prayer for
friendship; Philippians 4:4-13 as the reading; and 692 <i>O Saviour, Bless us
as we go</i> at the close. The speaker was Mrs. Edith Wills, former Duddeston
M.P., on “World Government”. She had plenty to say but I wasn’t always
convinced by her arguments. But as Mr. Thomas said, it made you think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At the services today we each
received a copy of the second <i>Quarterly Newsletter</i> containing news of
all the different organisations and activities in the Church. Pat Welch has

Youth Club is also included.</span></p>

typing out all my results and made seven graphs. I spent most of the lunch-hour
reading <i>The Kon-Tiki Expedition </i>– it is a most exhilarating book; I
don’t know why I have never read it before. It makes me realise how my tastes
have changed. Two or three years ago, this book, and others such as <i>Exploration
Fawcett</i>, would not have been half as interesting.</span></p>

afternoon I was counting or working out results, and washing up the specimen
bottles and some of the bench apparatus that hasn’t been touched since I
started. I didn’t get very much of this latter done but every now and again I
push the things along a bit more. It doesn’t get the washing up done, but the
psychological effect of seeing a little more clear space is astounding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            A letter from Mr. Taylor of
“Youth Page” this morning informed me that he would not be visiting the club
tonight as he had five other engagements and couldn’t get a photographer
anyway. He is coming instead on the 26th.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This means that Helen and I
won’t be able to see <i>Love From Judy</i>, so we will have to see Norman
Wisdom in April instead. As things turned out it was just as well that Mr.
Taylor couldn’t come – everything was disorganised because of the Youth
Festival activities that were going on – bugling and public reading included.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I went into the
hospital and [later in the lab] did some counting. I had to leave one sample
until Monday. Nothing much happened this afternoon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This evening Helen and I spent
a most enjoyable evening at the </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt'>Town
Hall. We had seats P1 and 2 on the Reserved Floor. The programme was:– </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            <i>La Boutique Fantasque</i> –
Rossini-Resphigi</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            <i>Invitation to the Dance</i>
– Weber-Weingartner</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            <i>The Sleeping Princess</i> –
Tchaikovsky</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            <i>An American in Paris</i> –
Gershwin</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            <i>Dances from Henry VIII</i> –
German</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            <i>The Swan</i> – Saint-Saens</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            <i>Coppelia Ballet Suite</i> –
Delibes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            <i>Polovtsian Dances</i>
(Prince Igor) – Borodin</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            George Weldon was guest
conductor and the house was packed. It would be difficult to pick out the best
of eight selections perfectly executed, but for me the highlight was George
Gershwin’s <i>An American in Paris</i> – its first </span><span lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span
lang=EN-GB> performance. It is a delightful work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I felt off-colour last night
and today I have a heavy cold. Clarice and Julia had it ten days ago, Mam last
week, and now it’s my turn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At work I have so much to do
that I hardly know where to start. There is counting to do, two sets of results
to calculate and type, a special series of results, graphs and statistical
calculations to be typed for a visit to the lab by some Chemical Societies
tomorrow, five or six graphs, and, of course, all of Rory’s jobs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>6.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> I got to the Hippodrome to buy
tickets for <i>The Norman Wisdom Show</i> on April 12th. There was a terrific
queue and the attendants would not let anyone else join it as the Box Office
closed at </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I and a few
others protested, but stood our ground and I got the tickets I wanted. When I
came away there was a queue several hundred strong behind me. It must have been
the most phenomenal rush for theatre tickets for years [probably since Danny
Kaye’s visit].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I did not want to go into Mr.
Hindle’s class two hours late, so I spent the rest of the evening at the Old
Edwardians Club in </span><span lang=EN-GB>New Street</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was determined today that I
would get most of my typing done even if it sent me daft. At </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> I decided it was sending me daft so I came
home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>7.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> I listened to The <i>Pattern in
Nature</i> – 2 – Box Hill in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Surrey</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, and the programme revived pleasant memories of my stay at Juniper
Hall last Easter. Geoffrey Hutchings and John Sankey were two of the speakers.
The others were Frank Jane, Professor of Botany at </span><span lang=EN-GB>London</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>University</span><span lang=EN-GB>; George
Bodley Ryle, Conservator of the Forestry Commission; and Eric Ennion who is

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At College this morning Miss
Richardson taught us the ear and the organs of taste and smell, then the
endocrine system. For practical we had an ox eye each, and we also drew slides
of the eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At work I had an interesting
discussion on religion with Les. I came back home at 5.0 and caught Helen’s
’bus. I knew Helen was on the ’bus even before I went upstairs because thee
girls getting off [at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bristol Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB>] gave me funny looks. I was amazed when Helen told me only <i>two</i>
of her friends had got off. The third one sounds an interesting possibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Taylor turned up at Club at
8.15 and stayed for half an hour, and I think I’ve given him an interesting
article. The photographer came later and took photos of a sing-song round the
piano [jpg], the discussion group (I got Mr. Dibben in) and a draughts game. I
led the prayers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I took my Saturday
off, got up at 10.30 and later went down to [Fox Hollies] park to get some
snails for the aquarium. We took Ginger and Dinah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I listened to the Grand
National this afternoon. Royal Tan (Bryan Marshall) won at 8-1, Tudor Line (G.
Slack) 10-1 was second by a neck, Irish Lizard (M. Scudamore) 15-2 was third. I
picked seven horses of which five finished – the first five! This seems all the
more remarkable when one consider that only nine horses completed the course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            In the [F.A. Cup] semi-finals,
West Bromwich Albion beat Port Vale 2-1 at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Villa Park</span><span
lang=EN-GB> after being 0-1 down, and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Preston</span><span
lang=EN-GB> beat </span><span lang=EN-GB>Sheffield</span><span lang=EN-GB>
Wednesday 2-nil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I took Helen to the Odeon
tonight. We got in a minute before the programme started. The main film was <i>Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes</i> with Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe. This was very similar
to <i>How to Marry a Millionaire</i> but not quite up to that standard, though
it was very good. I still don’t like the misses Russell and Monroe. Jane
Russell is colourless and Marilyn Monroe slobbers too much when she
articulates. Nevertheless the musical numbers were very well put over, in
particular “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” sung by M.M. Altogether then, a
very enjoyable and relaxing film, providing a contrast to the tension of <i>Seven
Days to Noon</i> (A) which I had seen before, at the Olton on 27th January
1951. It is a very gripping film and was well worth seeing again.</span></p>

came in yesterday and I had to ’phone him [from the telephone box] again at
10.30 this morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At Church the morning preacher
was Rev. W.S. Terry on God’s being everywhere. Mr. Dibben took tonight’s service
and gave us a fine sermon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I am always upset when Helen

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Today has been terribly

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Nothing much happened at work
today. I had to go to a play rehearsal this evening at </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Actually we did no rehearsing at all, but
had a rather length argument as to whether and when we should attempt to put on
the play. It was finally decided to put it on on May 22nd with a concert. It is
quite obvious that the play can never be put on in so short a time, and that a
decently rehearsed concert is equally ridiculous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            There was a letter for me from
Helen this morning which cheered me up rather. She said she was down in the
dumps until it arrived, and that Sister Sparks is a beast, making the P.N.S.
nurses work long hours every day. Eight of them, including Helen, were going to
cookery last night and a lecture on nutrition tonight. She didn’t miss the ’bus
on Sunday night, but </span><span lang=EN-GB>Alma</span><span lang=EN-GB> and
Patricia did. She says that if we decide to go to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Jamaica</span><span

felt so mentally and physically exhausted and so utterly depressed. We had an
exam at College this morning but I cannot recall much about the morning at all,
except that I had not the energy even to write. I’ve felt in a trance all day
and was glad to tramp about in the pouring rain before returning to work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Something made me get off the
’bus a couple of stops later than usual [beyond Edgbaston Park Road], so I went
up the private path through the University grounds and saw the unusual
spectacle of a chimney stack being felled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            As the canteen has closed until
the 26th, we now have our own tea groups. I have tea with Bill Dunn. This morning
I spent over an hour waiting for the milkman, but as he was very late we got
some milk from someone else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            For the first time this week I
felt happy when Helen and I went to see <i>The Moon is Blue</i> (X) at the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Bristol</span><span lang=EN-GB> [cinema], really happy when I held
her close to me. I think Maybe Helen felt that too, or perhaps her heart always
beats 98 a minute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Excellent though the play was,
the film was even better. It starred William Holden, Maggie McNamara and David
Niven, and has got an X certificate because it contains the words “virgin” and
“mistress”. The supporting film <i>The Dark Stairway</i> was a half-hour crime
film narrated by Edgar Lustgarten, not very good.</span></p>

down </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bromsgrove Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> for the

heart beat 98 times a minute [as I observed last night].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I promised Helen that I would
not get so depressed this week and I was much happier today than this time last
week. During the day I wrote to Helen [telling her that when she left the

that it will be 120 hours 35 minutes until we meet on Friday night].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The Geiger-counter started
behaving most stupidly every time I operated them. It seems we spent most of

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            “I do not understand your

night How do you know that they caught the bus and that I did not? …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I expect you will be surprised

the Scientific Technologists Association, John Winrow is also.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Dad’s pneumonia is much better
but his stay in bed has brought on a recurrence of his sciatica and he had to
go by ambulance to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Orthopaedic</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was much too late to go to
College so I had a morning in the open air and walked to town. It was a
beautiful, warm day and the walk did me more good than sitting in [Room] 516 at
College. I went to the <i>Evening Despatch</i> offices and various book-shops,
and waited for the </span><span lang=EN-GB>1 o’clock</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><i><span
  lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span></i><i><span lang=EN-GB> Mail</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB> to appear. “Youth Page” contained the write-up from my article on
the Club. The article [jpg] occupied the greater part of the page and is headed
“Club with its ‘Helping Hand’ team for action” – Mr. Taylor has made our Youth
Witness Team the focal point of our activities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was interesting to read that
I said we were lending a helping hand to other churches who are not happily off
for membership, because I didn’t even if we are! But Mr. Brian Williams [did
tell]Youth Page “we have the largest membership of any church in the circuit
with 2,000 members” and was completely up the creek. 2,000 is of course the
circuit membership; our church’s is 282. Perhaps the seven-fold exaggeration
may get us a few more people in the congregation – they might turn up
especially to see whether that 2,000 really is true. If they come once, they should
want to come again!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It is a good article though, and
there are three photographs. The top one is of an informal discussion group
where I am talking, with Helen on the extreme left of the picture next to me,
and Mr. Dibben (spelt Dibbend in the caption) on the extreme right. The middle
picture shows us all grouped around the piano, and the bottom one is of a
draughts game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I spent the afternoon in the

</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>* The third to crash, off </span><span

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>* The fourth B.O.A.C. Comet to crash
(yesterday, </span><span lang=EN-GB>8th April 1954</span><span lang=EN-GB>) was
G-ALYY (06011), the 11th to be produced (06011), and entered service in 1952.
As a result of these disasters, the Comet 1 was withdrawn from service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Dr. Pover was not at work this
morning. I typed the results of the week’s experiment and completed the graphs.
I came home through town and straight after dinner went out with Mam to buy me
a pair of shoes. During two and a half hours I must have tried on forty pairs –
we eventually got a pair at Freeman, Hardy &amp; Willis – the first shop we
went to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen and I went to the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Rialto</span><span lang=EN-GB> tonight to see <i>The Love Lottery</i>
(U) with David Niven, Peggy Cummins, Herbert Lom and Anne Vernon. The other
film was <i>Royal New Zealand Johnny</i> (U). They were both were very good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We put the clocks forward

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Rev. E. Bryan Harvey conducted
the service at church this morning. I only just got in on time. I rolled over
in bed, looked at my watch and found it was thirteen minutes to eleven.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After church I distributed
envelopes to all the houses in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hove Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Norland Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>
for the National Children’s Home. I expect I shall collect them later this
week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The Youth Team met at </span><span lang=EN-GB>4.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> in the church for a voice test. Mr. Dibben
thought I sounded mournful. Actually I was very happy because Helen will be
home for a month, and would not have to go out half-way through the evening
service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight the choir sang Eric H.
Thiman’s <i>The Last Supper</i>, so there wasn’t a sermon. The singing wasn’t
bad though sometimes it lacked balance. Apart from a couple of bad entries and
poor endings to words, the only particularly noticeable fault was an Amen by
the tenors – the screech still rings in my ears! The soloists were Ann Pardoe
and Alistair Sutherland.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At Y.P.F. afterwards we had a
talk on </span><span lang=EN-GB>Malaya</span><span lang=EN-GB> by Mr. John
Sweetman. It was interesting to hear his experiences, but rather irksome at
times because Mr. Sweetman’s official position made him unable to speak freely
on some aspects of life in that country. But the idea of everyone’s dipping
into a large soup-bowl with 8 foot long chopsticks and feeding the chap on the
other side of the table was nauseating. Helen and I don’t expect to visit </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Malaya</span><span lang=EN-GB> in a hurry!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I took Helen to the
Hippodrome to see Norman Wisdom. Mam and Dad also had tickets for the same
performance – there was a party from the B.S.A. We had seats G22 and 24 in the
Imperial Fauteuils. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Norman Wisdom appeared in four
or five sketches, helped by Jerry Desmonde, and while he scored a great
personal success, his material in general was rather poor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Today we finished work for the
Easter holidays. Most of the day I spent on the CV register. It is a hopeless
task because no additions or corrections have been recorded in it, and the
amendments to be made date back to 1946. As soon as I put in a new page I find
it out of date within five minutes. I’ll get the register completed when I have
a spare month or two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Just how much profit is being
made from our tea-club we don’t know but Bill Dunn is reputed to be buying a TV
set.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to the Holy Week service

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I took Helen to the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Rialto</span><span lang=EN-GB> this evening to see Frankie
Howerd’s first film <i>The Runaway Bus</i>. Following so soon upon <i>Trouble
in Store</i> it was bound to invite comparison with the Norman Wisdom film, but
I thought it a very good effort and we both enjoyed it. Frankie Howerd is a B.O.A.C.
coach driver who loses himself and a ’busload of passengers in the fog.
Margaret Rutherford and Petula Clark also starred. The supporting film was </span><i><span
  lang=EN-GB>Border</span></i><i><span lang=EN-GB> </span></i><i><span
  lang=EN-GB>River</span></i><span lang=EN-GB> with Joel McCrea and Yvonne de

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After lunch I cycled to [</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was the first match I had
seen since 23rd January – over 12 weeks ago, and only the sixth of the whole season.
They could only draw 2-2. Lane and Stewart scored.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I took Helen to the
Gaumont to see <i>Doctor in the House</i> (U). Dennis Vaughan has Richard
Gordon’s book and has been reading it aloud at work. It is about medical
students training to become doctors, with Dirk Bogarde, Muriel Pavlow, Kenneth
More and Kay Kendall (who were in <i>Genevieve</i>), and James Robertson
Justice as the surgeon. It was very funny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The first film was a documentary,<i>
Life in the Arctic</i> (U) with stunning photography. It was an excellent
programme.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I began the
enormous task of getting ready all the impedimenta for the classes on Monday
week.             During the day I gave some thought to the idea of a magazine
programme done by various friends of mine. (There isn’t enough material for a
Youth Club broadcast.) Bill Dunn might provide a trio, I could ask Bob and Ann
Pardoe to sing, and I’ve already written to Gerald Brindley to se if he can
provide some original music.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I took Helen to the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Rialto</span><span lang=EN-GB> tonight to see <i>Genevieve</i> (U)
and <i>The Lone Hand</i> (U). <i>Genevieve</i> [which I saw on 15th September
last year at the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Rialto</span><span lang=EN-GB>] was
even funnier a second time with Helen beside me, we laughed a lot. We also
enjoyed the other film, a Western, with Joel McCrea and Barbara Hale. It was about
a detective posing as a farmer in order to trap a gang of criminals. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went down the village on my
bicycle before 8.0 this morning to buy the <i>Birmingham Weekly Post</i> and
see whether Helen had won the Sewing Contest. She won the third prize (£3) in
Class 1 which I think was very commendable indeed. I must write a column about
Helen for the <i>Birmingham News</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At College Miss Richards taught
us the detailed structure of the Animal cell, and meiosis. We also started a
rat dissection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Not much happened at work. I
went to the fourth of Mr. Dibben’s Church membership classes at seven tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Afterwards I sat in the Church
during the Choir Practice as I guessed that Helen would come down to Choir when
she got back from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stratford</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I
had a letter from her this morning written on Wednesday night. She had been to </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Leamington</span><span lang=EN-GB> via all the tiny villages in
between, and was going for a walk by the river yesterday collecting primroses,
bluebells and cowslips. She has been hearing some very good reports about <i>Doctor
In The House</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen came round at </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> to watch the Cup Final between West

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>West Bromwich</span></b><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The church has been packed

lang=EN-GB> services, and Rev. W.C. Russell who was minister till about 1948,
the </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> service. It was a
pleasure to see the church so full – there wasn’t an empty seat in the place at
</span><span lang=EN-GB>6.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I read this evening’s
lesson – Matthew 18:1-14.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Nothing but work today! I had
10 minutes for my dinner hour and only thirty minutes off all day. There was a
hectic race against the clock to be ready for the class this afternoon – solutions
and apparatus and animals all had to be taken up to the Demonstration Theatre.
I had ten minutes to eat my sandwiches, then helped Rita to shave one of the
rabbits. Phillip Millington and I went up and down in the lift some twenty
times with the trolley. The class didn’t finish till </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>5.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and it was a further half an hour
before I left for College.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I stayed for an hour of
Photosynthesis then raced to church for the Anniversary service. I was still in
the Bull Ring at </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> but the
service started a minute or two late and I got in on time. Helen saw me and
came in and reminded me of the saying that it is easier to pretend to feel what
one doesn’t feel than to conceal what one does feel. Afterwards we walked to
the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Rialto</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight we walked along the
canal to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Solihull</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I think we
both felt very happy walking hand in hand by the water. The moon made the canal
as romantic as the winding </span><span lang=EN-GB>Avon</span><span lang=EN-GB>
– until </span><span lang=EN-GB>Solihull</span><span lang=EN-GB> gasworks
shattered the illusion. But it was soothing [unfinished]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to work on the S.B. this
morning. I have two patients from today. But the urine samples from Mr.
Comerford were rather interesting because they contained no [radio-] activity.
At least, I had thrown away the first two samples before Dr. Pover found that
the counter was switched incorrectly, but when the fault was corrected, there
was still no activity in the third sample. Perhaps the dose hasn’t been given,
or something. Especially “or something.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I haven’t seen Helen at all
today as she was having tea with Freda. I went to bed at 8.30 after taking the
dogs out, intending to do some writing and listen to the radio. But the
wireless went dead, and I felt too tired to write, so I went to sleep instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I don’t know why I have felt depressed
today. At work there was still no activity in Mr. Comerford’s samples, and then
none in the samples from the Children’s Hospital. We found the counter switched
to the solid castle, but by then the Comerford urines were down the drain.
Fortunately Dennis still had the faeces, so we may still obtain some sort of
result, but it was a frustrating day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>             Tonight I called for Helen and
we went to the Futurist to see what was described as the most significant
religious film, <i>I Beheld His Glory</i> (U), about the life, death and
resurrection of Christ. It has been showing since Sunday night, admission only
1/-d in the stalls and no one was allowed in after the film began. It was a
beautifully made film, in full colour, and very moving, especially Jesus’
appearances after the Resurrection. At the close there was an opportunity for
people to make a decision for Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            My article about Helen which I
wrote for the <i>Birmingham News</i> was sent in rather late and they only
printed one paragraph of it in the paper today. Nevertheless Helen seemed quite
delighted when I gave her a copy of it on my way home at dinner time. She’s
been in the paper on three successive Fridays and twice in two days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I didn’t leave work till 12.45
– I was busy all morning counting and arranging about the animals for Monday. I
went into the Hospital three times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight Helen and I went to the
Sheldon to see <i>Quo Vadis</i>, which I saw last November – the last occasion
on which I went to the cinema alone. Funny, but last November I wouldn’t have
dreamt of kissing in the cinema, and probably Helen didn’t at all until tonight

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            While we were at the cinema
last night David Torvell called with a couple of tickets for the B.I.F.
[British Industries Fair] service relay [from </span><span lang=EN-GB>St.
 Martin</span><span lang=EN-GB>’s in the Bull Ring] to the Odeon cinema. Helen
wasn’t keen to go as the tickets weren’t for </span><span lang=EN-GB>St. Martin</span><span
lang=EN-GB>’s, so Mam and Dad went instead. I was glad they were able to go;
they were especially keen to hear Billy Graham and were full of it when they
got back. The service was also relayed to several thousand people in the Rag
Market.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            God moves in a mysterious way …
When Mam and Dad went to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Mission</span><span

go with their coach party to hear Billy Graham at Harringay next Saturday. The
odds are that we shall be able to go, Clarice and Julia too, and at under £1
apiece. And, of course, the Queen returns to </span><span lang=EN-GB>London</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I didn’t cycle to work as I had

thunder and some lightning flashes. The storm really broke just as I got into
M.S. and it lasted over an hour, during which time the rain bucketed down [0.66
inches in 2½ hours]. The thunder seemed very close in the subterranean passages
of the Hospital</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got home about 6.15 (a change
to be early), not long after Mrs. Walker had gone. I spent the evening writing

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Miss Richards was away this
morning and Mr. Gardner took the class. We had a 40-minute question on Meiosis.
The rest of the time we were supposed to dissect our rats, but Mr. Gardner, who
hadn’t dissected a rat since 1932, spent seventy minutes showing us how, which
didn’t leave us much time. I learned more in that hour or so than everything
put together in my last two years at school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            There was plenty to do at work
but I managed to get away in time to meet Helen on the 1A. I had a very
affectionate letter from her this morning which I read several times . She says
she knows quite a bit of French and certainly understands what I wrote, but I
am not the first to say it to her (so who is the creep?). She felt terribly
alone on Monday night and still misses her home life and me. On Wednesday afternoon
the nurses went on a visit to the sewage works which was quite interesting, but
the man who organised it for them, Mr. Salt, was very superior and talked down
to them, even to Sister. She came home briefly but had to return at </span><span lang=EN-GB>8pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and wishes she could have seen me. They have
just been warned about the six or seven important exams at the end of this term
(I don’t envy her). My calculation was quite startling, she says. Also, Gillian
is spelt with a G but jilted is spelt with a j. [I had asked in my letter whether,
if Jill dumped her boyfriend he would have been jill-ted?] Helen assures me she
doesn’t show my letters to any kind of Cuckoo, and I was right about her having
breakfast in bed on Monday! She sends me all her love, and must see me soon –
which she did on the ’bus. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a meeting with Mr. Dibben

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At </span><span lang=EN-GB>Woodstock</span><span

Marlborough’s estate, or rather </span><span lang=EN-GB>Blenheim</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Palace</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The last
time I stood on the bank looking across the lake must have been in 1946 or 1947
while I was still at Camp Hill [see my entry for </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>7th September 1947</span><span lang=EN-GB>]. Helen liked </span><span

like to live in the country.</span></p>

cafeteria in Hyde Park, the four of us ate our sandwiches in Park Lane, then we
went a short way down Oxford Street before turning back to meet the rest of the
party in Hyde Park. We walked past the Serpentine, then to Admiralty Arch and
so to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Buckingham</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Palace</span><span lang=EN-GB> via Constitution Hill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            By now it was after </span><span lang=EN-GB>2.00pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and large crowds had gathered outside the Palace
and all along the route from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Westminster</span><span
lang=EN-GB> to see the Queen arrive home again. We took up a position to the
right of the Palace gates in front of the Victoria Memorial. We couldn’t see
much but were staking our hopes on a balcony appearance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At 3.25, the Queen stepped
ashore and church bells rang out, and at ten to four the Royal landau led by
the Windsor Greys swept into the Palace yard as the Royal Standard was hoisted.
Everyone cheered madly, and to a continual cry of “We want the Queen”, the
Queen, the Duke [of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Edinburgh</span><span lang=EN-GB>],
Prince Charles and Princess Anne then came out onto the balcony about 20
minutes later. Up to that moment, the only one of us who had really seen
anything was Julia who was sitting on my shoulders. Having seen all the Royal
Family – earlier we had seen Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and Princess
Margaret appear on a side balcony – we all set off to return to Hyde Park
Corner via the Mall (knee-deep in litter), Oxford Street, and tube train from
Piccadilly Circus to Marble Arch by way of Oxford Circus. We bought Mam and Dad
a box of chocolates, then we boarded the coach again and set off for Harringay.[space

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The car park was packed with
coaches from all over the country – we saw a party from </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Sunderland</span><span lang=EN-GB>. We had to wait quite a long
time before we could get into Harringay Arena – home of the Harringay Racers.
The arena was packed with 18,000 people, and they let more people in than
usual. I think the extra people were sitting on the floor. At the front was a
raised platform and behind, a massed choir of 4,000.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The first half an hour was
spent in singing hymns and choruses [led by Cliff Barrows], and prayers. We
sang at least two from the M.H.B. – <i>It is a thing most wonderful</i>, <i>Blessed
Assurance</i> and others we knew from Alexander’s Hymns No. 3.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I didn’t see Billy Graham
appear on the platform. George Beverley Shea sang and then Billy Graham stepped
forward, said a few words of prayer and announced his text, 1 Peter 1:18-19,
“Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as
silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your
fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish
and without spot.” His sermon was very simple and unemotional. At the end we
bowed our heads in prayer and he invited people to leave their seats and come
forward if they wished to receive Christ as Saviour. Literally hundreds began
to stream forward as we sang “Just as I am.” It was a wonderfully inspiring
service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We were all very tired on the
way home, but my brain was racing and I got a bad headache. I feel sure that
this is what the Lord is calling me to do.</span></p>

us. I took a Sunday School class this afternoon. Tonight the Youth Team took
the service at Castle Bromwich.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At Y.P.F. we had a gramophone
evening and heard a great variety of music. I took along <i>The Preacher and

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I spent the afternoon indoors
until 4.30 when I went down the village on my bicycle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen and I didn’t go to the
cinema tonight. There were no good films outside town and we both wanted an
early night, but above all we wanted to listen in to a broadcast [from 6.30 to
7.0 in the Light Programme] of part of Billy Graham’s final meeting at Wembley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The choir sang <i>Blessed
Assurance</i>, then the congregation sang <i>Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah</i>,
The readings were Psalm 100 and Ephesians 2:1-10, followed by a prayer. Then
George Beverley Shea sang <i>He’s got the whole wide world in His hands</i>,
after which Cliff Barrows conducted the Choir in the Hallelujah Chorus. Then Billy
Graham spoke for five minutes about the great spiritual hunger throughout the
nation, and urged everyone to go to Church tomorrow. The broadcast ended with <i>To
God be the glory</i>. It was just like being at Harringay last Saturday, I only
wish the whole service could have been broadcast, or better still, televised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Afterwards we watched <i>In
Town Tonight</i> at and at </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.30pm</span><span
lang=EN-GB> a [1934] film, <i>Orient Express</i>. After this we went for a walk
and I took Helen home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I did not expect to find myself
in bed for a day or two at all, but here I am. Dr. Gough, who came in to see
Clarice who has bronchitis, says I am suffering from nervous exhaustion and
have been overdoing things, which accounts for my having had six colds in five
months. Nothing can be done about my back. As I am still growing the muscles
are not hardened, and I shall continue to have fibrositis until I finish
growing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I have been a bit better today
but have had to stay in bed. Helen has been to see me tonight. I had a very
loving letter from her this morning. She says she will really have to take me
in hand and only let me do so much beside my studies, Also, when I say she
looks good and she denies it, she is not having me on. She could not make
herself look like an angel when she is not one by any means. She says she read
my letter in the privacy of her room as there were too many nurses looking for
letters and she had to wait for it. She is glad I didn’t quite die last week.
But in any case she had made a promise to see me this week and she hates
breaking promises, however small or insignificant they may be. If seeing me for
one evening tires me out, then she can’t be much good for me, can she? She wasn’t
torturing me purposely, only teasing me. She is not clear whether it was the
doctor or I who was treated for shock, but if I am going thinner I have to stop
that or she will have something to say in the matter. She thinks we will have
to wait much longer than a week, and even then she hopes I am going to make
more than two people happy, she and I for instance. Is there a possibility of
my leaving her for a year then? If so I am to tell her now so that she can
accustom herself to the idea, and she hopes she would still want me even if I
went for two years. She tells me to be cheerful and promises to see me tonight
at </span><span lang=EN-GB>7pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> which she has done, and
in a P.S. she says “Stamp collecting! Another interest of yours?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The doctor came at </span><span lang=EN-GB>midday</span><span lang=EN-GB> and gave me an Insurance note and a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I spent the afternoon revising
Physics, then tonight I took Helen to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bristol</span><span
lang=EN-GB> cinema to see the 3-D film <i>Kiss Me Kate</i> starring Kathryn
Grayson, Howard Keel, Ann Miller, Bobby Van and Keenan Wynn. The film, made by
MGM, was excellent. It was adapted from the Broadway musical in which the cast
are performing a musical version of Shakespeare’s <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>
and Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel have as tempestuous a marriage off stage as
Petruchio and Katherine do on-stage. It was very funny. The songs included “So
in Love”, “Always true to you in my fashion”, and “Brush up your Shakespeare”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The supporting film was <i>Welcome

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Physics! [I went to K.E.S. to
take the exam.]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I didn’t do terrible badly in
Paper 1 this morning, at any rate I was still writing at 12.30. But I missed
the 3 off a[cubed] in the equation 6 pi nav = 4/3 pi a{cubed)g(sigma minus
rho).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a hunch that viscosity
was on the menu, so I was really rather careless. I could have done 4 or 5
questions from Section 2, but we only had to do two, and four from Section 1.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Paper 2 was the worst I’ve ever
seen and I couldn’t do one question satisfactorily. I purposely omitted e/m,
Diode, and Polarisation from my revision. All three turned up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The only consolation today was Helen’s
letter this morning and seeing her tonight. She missed her ’bus again on Sunday
night as she did last week, but this week she won’t be leaving me. She was
going on the Women’s Ward, C6, and then hoping to have a proper game of tennis
if she was not too tired from overwork. She is thinking of me all the time, and
praying for me to have faith and confidence for the exams. Unexpectedly she was
having to do the Nurses’ 1st Part Preliminary today. She had just been to tea
and as an afterthought she looked in the cubby holes and found she had a letter
from Freda which she was going to read after she had posted mine. Helen saw my
mother yesterday for a few minutes but then the 31A came, so there wasn’t time
to ask how Clarice and Julia were. She was late for Miss Moore even then. Last
night Sister told her she was getting naughty because every night </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Elizabeth</span><span lang=EN-GB> has been ready for bed at </span><span lang=EN-GB>10pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and she hasn’t, and she used to be so good!
She has heard about me now anyway, the girls purposely were teasing her and
when Miss Moore asked what it was about they told her and made her blush. She
hopes my back isn’t troubling me and sends me all her love. In a P.S. she says
she believes me and I am to forget about holding other girls’ hands etc. as she
doesn’t mind (underlined), and then adds (in brackets) that is not strictly
true.</span></p>

did satisfactorily in the exam but no more. Question 1 required leaf sectioning
to show infection by a parasite. I made a complete mess of this. Qn. 2 required
a clear labelled drawing of a dicot.[dicotyledon] stem, 3 was a dissection of
the rat to show the heart and principal arteries in this region. Lastly, we had
to identify and write brief notes on (but not draw) the leg of a cockroach and

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had to go to work this
morning. Not much holiday for Whitsun now, nor for Helen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            College is closed all this week
but Mr. Rowe let me have the afternoon for study. I hardly dared to ask for the
time off. Dr. Sammons didn’t bring me the outstanding samples from the
Children’s Hospital till 11.30 so I was rather late getting away. I caught the
1.17 ’bus instead of the </span><span lang=EN-GB>12.17pm</span><span
lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I managed to get in several
hours Chemistry revision. At ten to seven I went to see Helen and went to the ’bus
stop with her. She said she felt naughty again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Nothing much happened at work
today. During the morning I wrote a letter to Helen. There was a seminar at </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Augustus Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> at </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>4.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> by Dr. P.J. Anderson. It was on “The
Role of Red-cell cholinesterase in Haemolysis by Surface-active compounds.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was very wet today.[0.4 inches
of rain fell and not a ball was bowled in any of the matches due to start
today].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I did something very unusual
today – got up at </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I went
out just after </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.30am</span><span lang=EN-GB> to wait
in a queue at Snow Hill station for the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Margate</span><span
lang=EN-GB> night train tickets. It was hardly worth queuing. There were only
four or five people in front of me and not more than a hundred behind me when
the booking office opened at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.0am</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. Mam arrived at five to nine. I got the tickets and reservations
for the </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> train on Friday
July 23rd, insurance cards, and a luggage form. It’s not often I spend £13 2s
0d before </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.30am</span><span lang=EN-GB>! I withdrew £9
from the Midland Bank yesterday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was very wet and windy again
today, and has been all week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            There being no College class
this morning I had to spend the whole day at work. During the morning I typed
my sermon for Sunday. I shall have to get the type-writer repaired as it is
jumping spaces all the time and leaving gaps in words.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I managed to get away at </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> as usual but I had a rush to screw the
bottom and sides onto one of the counter units which Dr. Pover asked me to do
at </span><span lang=EN-GB>4.45pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I caught the usual
’bus but Helen was one ’bus late so I didn’t see her until </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At least, it would have been
9.0 but there was no sign of the choir and I thought Helen must have gone home.
After checking that she wasn’t, I eventually found her at twenty to ten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Nothing very much happened at
work. I managed to do some more Chemistry revision.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I took Helen to a Town
Hall “Music You Love” concert by the C.B.S.O. with George Weldon conducting. Tickets
were on sale at the door so we had to queue but we got [3/-d] seats M34 and 35
in the Reserved Upper Gallery. We heard the <i>William Tell Overture</i> by
Rossini, <i>The Sorcerer’s Apprentice</i> by Dukas and the <i>Der Rosenkavalier
Suite</i> by Richard Strauss. The highlight of a highly enjoyable concert was
Colin Horsley playing Tchaikovsky’s <i>Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat minor</i>.

morning Helen, Freda and I caught the </span><span lang=EN-GB>10.23am</span><span
lang=EN-GB> ’bus to Sheldon where the Youth Team was conducting the morning
service. Ann Pardoe led, Michael Daw read, Jos Pardoe, Pat Welch and I spoke.
The Lyndon steward Mr. J. Moore led the interval prayers and read the notices.
It [the service] had more slickness than our previous two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben preached at
tonight’s service when John Hewlett, Lionel Hubbard, Ann Beddows, Glenys
Morgan, Janet Butler, Donald Birkin, Pat Welch and I were received into Church
Membership. We were each presented with a black leather-bound New Testament
with gold lettering and gold-edged pages, red ribbon marker and a small
certificate stuck inside with our name, date, and Mr. Dibben’s signature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was the last service in the
Church for several weeks as it is now to be repaired and redecorated, partly
re-carpeted and the lighting improved. The organ needs attention, and the
parlour, guild room and minister’s vestry too. It is going to cost £1,650.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            There was the usual class-work
to prepare for today. I had hardly a moment to spare but when I could manage to
do so I swotted Chemistry, finally completing my revision in bed tonight. With
four exams to do in as many days I would not have been able to write to Helen
today, so she is writing to me first this week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>             I see from tonight’s <i>Birmingham
Mail</i> that we had 0.57 inches of rain on Saturday, making the total for the
week 2.50 inches, and a further 0.14 inches up to 9.0am today. We have had 2.98
inches of rain so far this month but yesterday was dry. We have had quite a lot
of sunshine today. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Practical Physics B this
morning. I did an experiment with a cantilever which required us to find the
ratio of the slopes of two graphs of depression of the end of a metre rule
against the weights producing the depression. In the first case the weights
were hung at the end of the rule, in the second case, 20cm. from the end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            My second experiment was to
find the resistivity of a length of wire given an unknown resistance coil, and
a standard 1 ohm resistance. I didn’t finish, but gave a clear indication as to
how to get the answer, I hope! The other two experiments involved heating a
calorimeter and messing about with pins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a letter from Helen this
morning – she says she loves me ever such a lot and signs herself “Your
faithful Screwbob.” We saw each other this afternoon – I didn’t go to work

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At work I cleaned the formica
bench tops and re-organised Vo. 1 and Vol. 1A of the Mullard Book – the
registration of valve types has become so complicated that the various

Mullards are going by the alphabetical order which is much simpler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Practical Chemistry at </span><span lang=EN-GB>2.00pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> was pretty easy. The titration was a
double indicator one to find the gpl of Na2CO3 in a solution. My mixture Z1 was
whitish green, and struck me as being FeSO4 and NaCl, and I had finished by </span><span lang=EN-GB>4.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Hope I did everything right!</span></p>

Nothing much happened in the morning. In the afternoon I went down the village
and also to watch Helen playing tennis at the club [in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hazelwood

sunshine].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            There being nothing on anywhere
we went for a walk tonight. This time, Helen took me. We went to </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Solihull</span><span lang=EN-GB>, then via </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hampton
  Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB> across country and down some quiet leafy lanes.
Helen was absolutely terrified of some cows in a field we went through,
especially when one came to have a clear look at us.</span></p>

I feel I can relax again and concentrate on some writing and broadcasting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I liked this morning’s Biology
paper and I think I did quite well. I was writing furiously for three hours
except for five minutes when I had to go out – I drank too much for breakfast!
– and could have written a lot more. But I’ve no idea whether I’ve passed
Chemistry and Biology, but Physics has had it. I’m just praying I’ve passed in
the first two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            One thing I do know, whether
I’ve passed or not, and that is my nerves have been infinitely better than last
year. Perhaps it’s because Dr. Gough has been doping me with medicine. But I am
more inclined to the view that my steadied nerves is probably just one of the
beneficial effects of being in love! And above all, people have prayed for me. I
have been praying especially for Laurie Arthur and David Torvell [W.L. Arthur
and D.R.A. Torvell in the Medical VI and Science Upper VI respectively].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was Midsummer Day, and a
beautiful day too [12.1 hours of sunshine and the temperature reaching 71 degrees].
I sat in the garden reading after dinner. [Uncle] Reg is working in the park
and brought us some logs. In the evening</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:18.0pt'> </span><span lang=EN-GB>I finished a B.B.C. script

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a lovely letter from
Helen this morning, written in bed (like mine) on Tuesday night and finished

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I finished typing
my “Music from the Movies” script and sent it off. I hope I shall be able to
broadcast it but I’m not very hopeful as it is a bit too much like a “plug” for
films. I also had a talk with Bill Dunn about his trio for my magazine

talk on “Animal Facts and Fallacies” which I might use in the programme.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Dr. Shaw asked me whether I had
come across Neil Tuson at the B.B.C. Apparently they used to present a record

bought dried peas instead. I also went down to the tennis where I knew Helen
would be playing. I wonder whether anyone has ever told Helen what a pretty
pair of legs she has! Much too distracting really, and leg glances ought to be
confined to cricket, together with maidens and slips and fine legs and things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen came home last night and
obviously didn’t want me to know but of course I did. Julia saw her with Mrs.
Walker and later I saw Mrs. Walker herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a letter from Helen this
morning. It seems the Cuckoos purloined my last letter and she didn’t get it until
Tuesday afternoon. I must say Helen doesn’t seem so awfully certain that I shalln’t
spank her as she threatens never to speak to me again if I do! She has had one
lecture from me already this week, another at Hospital on Wednesday, and is
expecting another from me tomorrow. Especially as she says she is always
thinking of me even when she is watching the medical students playing tennis,
and saying “hello” to the porters and ambulance men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            From 9.30 until 12.30 I washed
up the class apparatus and packed what we didn’t require for the lab, into a
box which I returned to Bill. I nearly committed suicide getting the box off
the top of the hot room. The step ladder I was standing on slipped, and I was
left hanging in mid-air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner several members of
the department went to a meeting of the Christian Union in the men’s lounge of
the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Union</span><span lang=EN-GB>. There was a tape
recording of a sermon by Billy Graham which he gave at a </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            When I took Helen to the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Rialto</span><span lang=EN-GB> tonight it was the first time we
had been to the cinema for a month and only the third time since May 8th. We
saw <i>Conflict of Wings</i> in Eastmancolor, the conflict being between some </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Norfolk</span><span lang=EN-GB> villagers and the R.A.F. when the
R.A.F. want to use an island bird sanctuary as a low-flying rocket range. This
was one of those pleasant, sincere pictures that is tender without being
over-sentimental, and thoroughly enjoyable. Any film which can set out some of
the beauty of the English countryside, I always like to</span><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'> </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>see, and here,
the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Norfolk</span><span lang=EN-GB> seen was
beautifully photographed. I liked the air of authenticity throughout – the set
of villagers, the Air Force types, none overplayed. Muriel Pavlow, John
Gregson, Kieron Moore and Niall MacGinnis played their parts excellently, and
the flying scenes of whining jets were cleverly worked in without their ever
becoming tedious. Altogether, an extremely pleasant 90 minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            <i>Geraldine</i> (U), a film I
wanted to see because it was a sort of skit on the popular song business, was
rather disappointing. John Carroll is a College music teacher who is discovered
by Mala Powers and becomes a nationwide hit. The film was only spasmodically
funny because it went on too long. I wish we could have seen more of Stan
Freburg as a Johnny Ray type.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning the Youth Team led
a Children’s Service at Water Orton. Mr. Pardoe took Helen, Freda and me in his
car, together with Ann. Helen and I sat together in the front of the car. I had
not prepared a sermon except for a line or two of notes, but I had rather a
shock when we got to the Church because there were only three or four adults
there, and my sermon which was intended for the adults had to be changed into
one for the youngsters only. I had no idea what to say until I got into the
pulpit. Len Boden led the Service, Freda and Pat Welch read, and Ann, Pat and I
spoke respectively on “The Kings who didn’t write, didn’t fight, and didn’t
quite.” My “King” was Agrippa who said “Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian” in Acts 26:28.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben took tonight’s

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I am not sure what can be done
with the lab. We have a new piece of furniture – a chest of drawers that cost
only 50/-d when the same thing in metal would have cost £20-£25 – and nowhere
to put it. We’ve benches round the wall, a hot room, desk, telephones, an oven,
a refrigerator, and no spare space. The drawers will have to go where the filing
cabinet is, and the filing cabinet will have to go. It would look very nice in
my bedroom if I could drop enough hints. The trouble is, we can hardly reach
the new cupboard now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I think the solution is to
knock a couple of walls down, or alternatively not to bother about the door. We
could come in through the French windows after walking across the lawns; only
if we negotiate the gas cylinders, we would probably get broken necks getting
across the bench. The lab is a stupid one anyway – if you flood the hot room
floor to a depth of two or three inches, the water seeps through and drops on
people reading in the library below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I am extremely curious as to
what port of the museum is immediately above the loft. I think I shall have to
drill a hole in the ceiling, push a stick through, then pop upstairs to see
exactly where I am.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The fish pond in the gardens
between the M.S. and Q.E.H. is rather interesting also. Apart from the
water-lilies, it contains two kinds of fish. There are goldfish and another
kind which I think are pilchards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went into the Hospital today
to get some stamps. I found my way to the Q.E. Post Office at the second
attempt. At the first attempt I discovered an underground passage, half of it
unlit, ending in a wall and two doors. I didn’t go any further but I found out
later that it leads to Nuffield House.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Today has been rather unusual.
Of major importance was the fact that I got turned down at my B.B.C. audition.
Peggy Bacon says that as I am now an adult I am competing with all the top-line
broadcasters, and my voice is not yet of good enough quality. It has a slight
“kink” to it and I speak with an accent. Peggy says I ought to go to a Voice
Trainer if I am really serious about the B.B.C. and want to be a good
broadcaster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            On the other hand, while I am
keen to improve my speech, I do not much like the idea of having to acquire a
B.B.C. accent. Rather have a distinctive accent than become a stereotyped
B.B.C. type pronouncing “room” as “rum”, “chocolate” as “chocklit”, “nine” as
“nane” and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The B.B.C. want me to keep
writing scripts if they are up to the standard of “Music from the Movies”.
Someone else will read this script, but I have brought it back with me so that
I can make it more impersonal. Otherwise it seems to me that there will be a
clash of personalities between the writer and the broadcaster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Any work of mine which is
accepted will be paid for, and Peggy says I would get full credit in the <i>Radio
Times</i>.</span></p>

  lang=EN-GB>Luxembourg</span><span lang=EN-GB>!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            By this morning’s post came the
first proof of my article “My Side of the Mike” for <i>Youth</i>. It was
perfectly correct and I sent off the proof to the press, posting the letter in
the Hospital at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.30am</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I have received from the B.B.C.
a programme pass for <i>Orchestral Hour</i> on Friday afternoon. I got this for
Mr. Walker but, as I expected, the time was unsuitable. The funny thing was
that just before I was about to go round to Walkers’, Mrs. Walker herself
called with a note to explain that Helen would not be home today and came home
yesterday. Mrs. Walker need not have told me as I knew last night. Somehow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was very dark and raining
when I went off to work. After going across to the Hospital to post my letter I
did half an hour’s work on the CV Register, then after tea, spent most of the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Of course, when I tried to do

<p class=topic><span lang=EN-GB>No summer this year</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning it was, raining as
usual. I think we all have a psychological inclination to bemoan the weather,
and never a year goes by without some month being the dullest, coldest,
wettest, foggiest in living memory. Yet the fact is that this year has been
worse than I or anyone else can remember. So far this year we have not had more
than one or two consecutive days of sunshine and there still seems no evidence
of our ever having any summer this year. At the moment, the temperature is some
four or five degrees below the seasonal normal, and has been so for the last
nine weeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Nothing very much happened at
work today. As Mr. Walker was unable to use the ticket for the M.L.O. [Midland
Light Orchestra] Concert, John and I arranged with Mr. Rowe to take our lunch
hour rather later than usual so that we could go. We omitted to say that it
needed to be about an hour longer as well. We came out at </span><span lang=EN-GB>1.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            <i>Orchestral Hour</i> was
broadcast from the studio in the Vestry Hall, Islington Row. We got there by
walking from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bristol Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>, up
Holloway Head and Bath Row. The Concert lasted from 2.0 until 2.40 and
consisted of Sir George Dyson’s “At the Tabard Inn” from the <i>Prelude</i> to
the Canterbury Pilgrims, <i>Summer Evening</i> by Kodaly, and Beethoven’s <i>Prometheus</i>
– the finale to the ballet. Leo Wurmser conducted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Apart from the orchestra, and
announcer Richard Maddock at his own table, John and I were the only people in
the studio. We were perched very comfortably on settees. It was a novel
experience seeing the M.L.O. doing a concert in the studio. Shirt sleeves was
the order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Neither John nor I had heard
Kodaly’s <i>Summer Evening</i> before, and at first hearing we both enjoyed it
very much. I couldn’t help comparing it with Delius’s <i>Summer Night on the
River</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I met Helen after Choir
practice and we went for a walk. I had a lovely letter from her this morning. The
trip to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Austin</span><span lang=EN-GB> works was
cancelled and as she had only two hours off duty she came home on Tuesday instead.
She came equal top in the Practical exam with 76% but has got Hygiene,
Bacteriology, and Anatomy and Physiology exams next week. Afterwards she has
five weeks’ holiday until going on the wards on 1st September. Before then she
has to try to finish making two summer dresses. She sends me much love and a
kiss. </span></p>

spent the afternoon re-writing “Music from the Movies”. It poured with rain
again [0.225 inches falling in an hour and a half], but before dinner I had
walked round the village with Ginger and Dinah. I wanted to take Helen to the

then went to Nuffield House with a parcel left by David. During the rest of the
day I prepared some graphs for my own personal use when I leave Radiochemistry,
and finished a letter to Helen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was very fortunate to catch

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This year I have brought my
Diary on holiday with me, and I am writing this rather belatedly in the Ralphs’
dining room at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.00pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> on
Monday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At work [today Friday] I completed
all the different jobs I had planned to do, but didn’t do any more
stock-taking. My wages this week amounted to £10 10s 0d – it should have been
ten bob more as I get a rise each birthday. I came out of work at </span><span lang=EN-GB>4.45pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> but it was still about 5.30 when I got
home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen came to tea and
afterwards, when it stopped raining, we went for a walk together to </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Solihull</span><span lang=EN-GB> and Shirley. I felt rather
miserable and couldn’t find words to say what I felt. I wanted so much to kiss
Helen but it would only have made things worse. I had been dreading the moment
of saying goodbye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I just couldn’t get excited
about going away, and I was so wrapped up in my thoughts and feelings that I
never noticed we were waiting at the 31A ’bus stop instead of the 44.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was better when we got to </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Moor Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>, and for the first of many
occasions I thought to myself “Is it really a year since we last did this?” As
we queued in the Station Goods Yard, the atmosphere reminded me somehow of a
pub. People talking, some occasionally singing, excited people, jolly people,
and some tired people. I wanted to go to sleep with Helen in my arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>11.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and the train pulled out of </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Moor Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. At twenty to twelve we were
racing through Acocks Green and Olton. I wanted Helen to be thinking of me</span><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'> </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>in those few
fleeting moments, so that I could feel we were close together, and then I
realised what a selfish wish that was, and hoped that she was fast asleep so
that she might not feel as miserable and lonely as I was. I fell into an
uncomfortable sort of sleep, one in which I liked to imagine for a time that
this wasn’t really happening, and that if I opened my eyes I would find Helen
there with me. As the night passed on, the thing became a dull ache in my
heart. How I love her. Surely this can’t be imagination. If only we could have
been together the whole fortnight. God willing, one day we will be together for
always …</span></p>

used to do last year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After breakfast we walked along
the sea-front and visited the Pier. I bought <i>The Colditz Story</i> by P.R.
Reid, a Pan Book. The weather was very miserable and with rain threatening we
went for a cup of tea and I read my book. It began to rain on the way back, and
as it was still pouring down after dinner we stayed in and I wrote a letter to
Helen. Later in the afternoon I went to the post, walked round the streets and
went to see what was on at the Hippodrome.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I continued reading my
book. Mr. Ralph entertained us with stories of his Naval experiences.</span></p>

fine enough but then the rain came down in torrents. I had my first swim of the
year in the pool with Dad and Clarice and Julia, but didn’t stay in long. We
spent the morning sitting under the Sun Deck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I also went to the [British]
Home Stores and Woolworth’s to buy some stationery. I didn’t get my usual paper
but bought some pretty much like it. Later I wrote letters. Tonight I sat in
the shelter reading. Later I went to Dreamland to meet Mam and Dad. It was High

nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I walked many miles today,
along Marine Terrace to the Clock Tower and the Jetty, and from there to the
Lido, Walpole Bay, and Cliftonville, then back along Northdown Road to
Dreamland (where Lobby Lud of the <i>News Chronicle</i> was going to be between
2 .0 and 3.0pm), and from there to Westgate front and so back to Grove Gardens.
The weather was very miserable but I enjoyed the walk</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to a meeting at the </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen didn’t get my letter
until second post on Monday. They came to fetch her on Sunday night. She is
having a good time but missing me and her home-life, more so than when she is
at the hospital because she simply can’t be unhappy for long amongst fourteen
girls. She is very busy helping with all the shop business and was going to
cycle to another village with Ruth. On Monday morning she went to </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Oxford</span><span lang=EN-GB> with Mr. Lightfoot and visited the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Churchill</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, and they went for a run round the Cotswolds in the evening. Helen
went to the service on Sunday morning [back in the Church for the first time
since 13th June] and there were two christenings [actually three: Martin Loxham
Taylor, Kathryn Jane Parkes Richard Allan Spoor]. She couldn’t go in the
evening, of course, and doesn’t want to miss next Sunday but doesn’t know if
she will be home by then as the Lightfoots (or should it be Lightfeet?) may
want her to stay. She keeps being teased about me, and waits for the postman
each day. She sends me a big kiss and expects me to be so strong and healthy
when I return that she won’t be able, even if she wanted to, to take her hand
out of mine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner we went down to
the beach. Having run out of reading matter I went on a tour of all the
bookstalls looking for a book to buy. I eventually decided on <i>The House of
the Arrow</i>, the classic detective story by A.E.W. Mason [published by Hodder
and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stoughton</span><span lang=EN-GB> as a yellow
paperback, 2/-d]. I wanted to see the film of this but didn’t. It starred

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This has been quite the nicest
birthday I’ve ever had. If only Helen were here to have shared it with me. I
had cards from Mam and Dad, Clarice and Julia, the Ralphs, Carole, and of
course Helen [with a letter inside]. Mam and Dad gave me a £1 towards a tennis
racket, Carole gave me a two shilling piece [florin] which in a way meant just
as much, and the Ralphs gave me Basildon Bond stationery. Helen has been
naughty and says she has something for me but I can’t imagine what it is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After breakfast we walked up to
Cliftonville as the <i>Daily Sketch</i> Guineas Girl was to be there. About </span><span lang=EN-GB>midday</span><span lang=EN-GB> we went into the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Lido</span><span
lang=EN-GB> where Ben Willis was playing as usual. He asked if it was anyone’s
birthday – there were a couple of wedding anniversaries – then Mam told him it
was my birthday and I had to go up onto the stage. So a great mob of a thousand
or more people sang “Happy Birthday” while I just stood there. I don’t know
what my real feelings were during those few moments, but before I knew what was
happening, onto the stage popped the Guineas Girl to present me with a crisp
pound note and a shilling piece. She was quite charming but seemed almost as
shy as I was. But it was a nice surprise nevertheless. A loud cheer went up
when I said I came from Acocks Green in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span
lang=EN-GB>; it makes me think that half the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Margate</span><span

came in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            On my way back to dinner I saw
Mr. Ralph outside the shop and surprised him with the news. I am the nineteenth
person to have got the <i>Daily Sketch</i> from the shop and won a guinea, and
the winning shopkeeper gets a prize too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The preacher was Rev. J.
Passmore Braithwaite and his sermon was on Ecclesiastes 9:10, “Whatsoever your
hand findeth to do, do it with your might.” It was intended for those of us on
holidays. Now was the time for us to leave behind all the worries of the daily
routine. We should live for the day and not worry. It was a most enjoyable
service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            On the way back Mrs. Penny told
me how she became a Christian at a meeting held by the Brothers Wood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. and Mrs. Penny go down to
Box Hill quite often and have offered to put me up any time I would like to go
down to London. Helen could go too. Mr. and Mrs. Penny were together on Box
Hill when the [Great] War broke out in August 1914 – 40 years ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            By dinner time it was very hot,
but during the afternoon when we sat on the beach, the sky clouded over. I had
a swim in the sea after I had written a letter to Helen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            In the evening Mam and I looked
in a lot of the jewellers shops to find something I can buy for Helen. I
thought I might buy nylon stockings but a necklace would be better. When it
started to rain we went into Dreamland and sat in the usual shelter. After a
few minutes the rain stopped, so I went for a walk to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Walpole</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bay</span><span lang=EN-GB> and saw the
illuminations in Cliftonville. Sunday night and the Public Houses full. For
some reason or other, singing in a pub always depresses me. Tonight I felt
terribly lonely without Helen; I walked back along the beach and the deserted
Westbrook front.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            When Mrs. Ralph came in with my
tea this morning, she brought a copy of the <i>Daily Sketch</i> which Mr. Ralph
had inscribed “Brian’s Special Edition”. As usual, the paper is “not strictly
true”, as Helen would put it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Bank Holiday! And the papers
promised heavy rain. That was not strictly true either as it has been fine all
day. I think it’s raining as usual in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span

the second day’s play between Warwickshire and Derbyshire. On Saturday
Warwickshire were all out for 106 and Derbyshire made 97 for 7. This is a vital

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            During the morning I went to

Guineas Girl again. Later I walked to the harbour and bought <i>The Frogmen</i>,
The Story of the Wartime Underwater Operators by T.J. Waldron and James
Gleeson, a Pan Book, illustrated, 2/-d.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This afternoon I went to the
Post Office and sent Helen a slice of my birthday cake [which I forgot to
mention Mrs. Ralph made for me]; it cost 5d. to post. Afterwards we all went
down to the beach and I went for a swim. Later we had a Neapolitan Ice-Cream.
Tonight we have walked to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Lido</span><span
lang=EN-GB> again and also looked at the shops. I got a necklet for Helen.</span></p>

our holiday so far, the weather being very warm and generally sunny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After breakfast we all went
down to the beach and we had a swim in the pool. I took some photographs, including
one of Dad diving. I’ve always thought it imagination that the pool should be
colder than the sea. Now I know it isn’t. Obviously the sand warms up much more
quickly than the concrete and makes the sea warmer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We swam in the sea again at </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> when it was nearly high tide. I took the
film to be developed and bought a new one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I’ve been to an
Open-Air meeting and to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Lido</span><span

round the shops, looking at the second-hand shops especially, after which we
visited Dreamland before coming back at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.30pm</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            When we came on holiday I
wanted to speak at the Open-Air meetings on the slipway but didn’t feel able
to. I prayed that if God wanted me to speak would He please tell me? Tonight at
</span><span lang=EN-GB>8.45pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> I asked again, this time
that one of the preachers would himself ask me, so that I should not have to
make the decision in any strength of my own. No sooner was the prayer uttered
than a Brother looked at me and asked if I would like to speak, and I did speak
for the first time at an Open-Air meeting for a quarter of an hour. Thanks be
to God, never a prayer is unanswered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I fetched the
photographs from Robinson’s and also went for a swim. We walked to Cliftonville
again and visited </span><span lang=EN-GB>Holy</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trinity</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Church</span><span
lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>FRIDAY 6th AUGUST</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight, our last night in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Margate</span><span lang=EN-GB> for at least a year I expect, I
have again spoken at the Open-Air meeting on the slipway. I was helping Dad
pack and fasten the cabin-trunk until 8.30, so it was 8.45 before I got down to
the beach, but then Fred the Barber asked me to give a message and I was able
to speak for twenty-five minutes through the Holy Spirit. I had no real plan to
go on, sometimes I had no idea what my next ten words would be till God put
them in my mouth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It’s strange but even now I
don’t know the names of my three new-found friends. Fred the Barber [Fred
Hodgkinson] was saved 7 years ago at the age of 35. He was a Champion Darts
player and a heavy drinker. Apparently, someone wrote a letter to the <i>Daily
Herald</i>, today I think, about Fred’s charging only 1/-d for a haircut (8d.
for invalids, pensioners and the unemployed) and 3d for a shave. What a
testimony to God’s Saving Grace!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Another Brother who carries a
banner and whom I was too late to hear speak, comes from </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Slough</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I think he said he is looking for
work. The Brother who in the main is responsible for these meetings, whom I met
for the first time last Tuesday week, is a Margate man [Cyril Plater] who once
upon a time had a bad reputation in these parts. As a Ballroom Dancer he won
over 20 cups at Dreamland. He also drank heavily, but was saved thirteen years
ago at the Siege of Tobruk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            God willing, I will be able to
come here and meet them again next year, and speak the unsearchable riches of
God …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Our swim yesterday afternoon
turned out to be our last. It rained heavily half the morning and afternoon and
we would have been unable to get the towels dry in time to pack them. At 8.30 I
went for a jog-trot to Westgate and back, then after breakfast we all got
together in the garden to take photographs. Then we went shopping and as it was
by now raining heavily we had to come back on the ’bus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner we stayed in till </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> then walked to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Lido</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. By now it had stopped raining. We came home through the town,
looked at the ruined </span><span lang=EN-GB>Holy</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trinity</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Church</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, went through the Old House in </span><span lang=EN-GB>King Street</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, which was put up between 1600 and 1625 it is thought, though no
one knows much of its history, and looked through the usual junk shop. Here I
got a book bargain, <i>The Pocket Guide to British Birds</i> by R.S.R. Fitter
and R.A. Richardson for 4/-d.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At tea Mrs. Ralph had made Mam
a lovely birthday cake. Mam had a number of cards and some jewellery from us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Unknown to me, Mam heard me
speak at part of tonight’s meeting. After I had said Goodbye to my friends,
Mam, Mrs. Penny and I went to Dreamland, then the eight of us came home
together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I haven’t heard from Helen
since my birthday. I do pray nothing’s wrong. Now it’s past </span><span lang=EN-GB>12.15am</span><span lang=EN-GB> [Saturday] and I am lying down to sleep …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=topic><span lang=EN-GB>Slow train to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            And now it’s </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and we’re back home once again. We had
breakfast at 7.45 and in less than half an hour we were all saying Goodbye once
again. Once more we were all thinking “Is it really a year since we did this?”
On the way to the station we called at the shop and said Goodbye to Mr. Ralph.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We had reserved seats on the
9.10 train. At least, the seats were reserved until the train came into the
station. Hundreds of people rushed for the train and took up the reserved
seats. Eventually we got seats in one of the Broadstairs compartments as none
of the Railway officials seemed to know where our coach was. The station
authorities were at fault in allowing passengers without Seat Regulation
tickets to enter the platform before the 9.10 had left. Obviously many on our
train had booked for the later train at 9.18.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            One could hardly blame them. We
got into Snow Hill at 4.20 – 66 minutes late, and a train from Ramsgate which
left before ours, was then 104 minutes overdue. I wonder whether the 9.18 has
got in yet! The train lost most time when a Western Region engine took over at
Redhill at </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.35am</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I imagine
we were then not more than fifteen minutes late. There was a further delay just
outside the station at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Oxford</span><span lang=EN-GB>.
Even the run from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Leamington</span><span lang=EN-GB>
took 42 minutes. Altogether the journey took 7 hours 10 minutes. Last year the
same train took 6 hours 48 minutes, and in 1951 the 9.18 train took 6 hours 39
minutes. British Railways are getting worse. If the trains are unable to run
faster, why aren’t the timetables re-written to show the correct time of
arrival? So far as I can recall, the only trains I have travelled on which have
run exactly as scheduled have been on the Birmingham-London run.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            But any thoughts about how late
we were, vanished as we clambered out on Platform One, thankful to God for a
safe journey. The sun was shining, though elsewhere on the journey it was
raining heavily. How happy it is even to come back to smoky </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span lang=EN-GB> after a fortnight’s absence. We
were home at </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I [had]
cancelled the newspapers but they were still all behind the door when we got
in. For me, there was a card from John Winrow written from </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Exeter</span><span lang=EN-GB> on July 23rd, a birthday card from
David Torvell sent from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Weymouth</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dorset</span><span lang=EN-GB>, on the
30th and a letter from Mr. Bloomfield postmarked July 25th. There was also a
ticket for <i>Orchestral Hour</i> on August 23rd which the B.B.C. sent me two
days ago. Now, as usual, I’ve got a large pile of correspondence to catch up
on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            David’s card said:– “God grant
that your birthday may be a happy one: happy if it be His will, in worldly
Quietness and outward Peace.” Simple thoughts such as these mean so much… It <i>was</i>
a happy birthday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Almost immediately I went round
to see the Walkers. Helen is not returning until tomorrow evening. I stayed in
all the evening and at 11.20pm listened to a commentary by [space left] from Vancouver
on the “Mile of the Century” in which Roger Bannister, first man to beat the
4-minute mile (3 mins 59.4 secs on May 6th) was meeting John Landy who holds
the record (3mins 57.9 seconds on 21st June). It was a terrific race. Landy
led, Bannister drew closer, Landy pulled away, then in a brilliant finish
Bannister overhauled Landy and won in 3 minutes 58.8 seconds. Landy’s time was
3 minutes 59.6 seconds. [An estimated 100 million people listened to the
commentary.] </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            When I went to Church this
morning it was the first time I had been in the church itself since June 13th
when I became a member. I suppose it was June 6th when I last sat in my usual
place. What a lot has happened since then, just in nine weeks!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Terry led the morning
service and gave a very good sermon on Mark 4:40 – “Why are ye so fearful? How
is it that ye have no faith?” Mr. Terry mentioned many of our own fears and I
felt there was a special point in it for me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was good to see so many of
one’s friends once again. My suntan is apparently quite noticeable, the more so
because it’s poured with rain more or less every day here in Birmingham [3.24
inches of rain in two weeks].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This afternoon I took a Sunday School
class. The story was of Lays the sculptor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben preached tonight and
straight after the service I went round to the Walkers. Helen still hadn’t
returned but I waited in the house for her. She arrived with Mr. and Mrs. Lightfoot
and Ruth in the car at about </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.15pm</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. And then my heart seemed to stand still. My own darling sweetheart
back again. I started to love her all over again. The first thing she asked me
was whether I had received a letter from her yesterday at </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Margate</span><span lang=EN-GB>, but we left before the post
arrived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen’s letter arrived this
morning, redirected from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Margate</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. She wrote it late on Thursday at Hook Norton, and posted it on
Friday, expecting I would receive it before we left on Saturday, but of course
we had to be at the station very early. She thanks me very much for the letter
and the lovely birthday cake which she and Ruth shared on a picnic last
Wednesday. She wasn’t able to write earlier as they have had to go delivering.
Mr. Lightfoot has given her a small cheque for helping in the shop!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen is also having a day off
on September 4th so that she can be a bridesmaid at her cousin Patricia’s
wedding at Shottery. She and Poppet are to wear pale blue dresses, Poppet being
Ruth’s fiancé’s younger sister. Mrs. Walker ’phoned Matron who readily gave
permission for Helen to have that day off. Helen says she and Ruth have been
doing some cycling, including a visit to Compton Wynyates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was a very wet and miserable
day. I called for Helen tonight and we went to the Futurist to see <i>Beneath</i>
<i>the Twelve-Mile Reef</i> (U) which has now been running for four weeks. It was
in CinemaScope, with Robert Wagner, Terry Moore and Gilbert Roland. It was very
spectacular, set in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Florida</span><span lang=EN-GB>
with amazing underwater photography, but rather contrived. </span></p>

days. Dr. Pover was only in for a short time and won’t be in again this week.
David is also away. I spent the morning washing up, and in the afternoon I
started a stock-taking of the chemicals. I was thinking of Helen all day long
as usual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We walked to </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Solihull</span><span lang=EN-GB> tonight, and walked across the
fields till it was quite dark. We came back on the ’bus and were home before
10.15. We were both rather serious all night. I told Helen that as soon as I
get into a comfortable position in a few years time I would marry her (D.V.) if
she loved me. But Helen says she would have to give up nursing then. The pros
and cons of being a careers girl! But Helen ought to marry some time, even if
it isn’t me. Anyway, I paid £1 5s into the Bank today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Most of today I’ve been
continuing with the stock-taking of the chemicals. During the dinner hour I
finished reading my Peter Cheyney book <i>Dressed to Kill</i> and the biography
at the beginning of the book. Peter Cheyney had sampled school, free-lance
writing, law, the theatre, while still in his teens. Throughout his life he
accumulated a first-hand knowledge of crime and the underworld. He always
maintained that fact was stranger than fiction, and his novels were all based
on his true-life experience of crime. He only began writing novels in 1936 but
until his death in June 1951, he turned out an average of two, sometimes four
novels a year.</span></p>

amounted to £4 2s 10d less 5/9d Insurance and 3/- Income Tax. I don’t know

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Sam Roe left today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            During the afternoon I emptied
the cupboard in the loft and re-arranged its contents, reprints, papers, books,
manuals, valve catalogues and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I called for Helen at Church at
</span><span lang=EN-GB>nine o’clock</span><span lang=EN-GB>. As she didn’t
feel very well we didn’t go for a walk, and it had started to rain anyway. I
went to bed at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.45pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I’ve had a lot of letters
lately, but the most interesting came this morning – my B.B.C. contract for “Music
from the Movies”. My fee is five guineas – the same as what I should receive if
I myself were doing the broadcast. So long as the B.B.C. continues to pay me as
well as this I don’t mind if I never broadcast again!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I went with a
S.T.A. outing to visit the Industrial Research laboratories in Brasshouse
Passage, off </span><span lang=EN-GB>Broad Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>. We
met outside the Hall of Memory at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.45am</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. John [Winrow], Jean, Phil [Phillip Millington] and Mrs. Sandy were
among those from Pharmacology</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This afternoon I cycled to the
Tennis Club to see Helen play. This evening we walked to Knowle, but it rained,
and we came back on the 10.5 [Midland Red 155] bus, arriving at Acocks Green at

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Rev. E. Bryan Harvey led this
morning’s service. His sermon was on the power of God: “All power is given unto
me in heaven and in earth” (Matthew 28:28). Tonight Mr. Dibben spoke on 1 John </span><span lang=EN-GB>4:18</span><span lang=EN-GB>, “There is no fear in love; but perfect love
casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made
perfect in love.” As usual, I could find something of special help to me in
both sermons. Too often [unfinished]     </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Last night I wrote a letter to
Helen and I put it through her letter box before cycling to work this morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was very busy all day and had
no morning tea-break. There was quite a lot of washing up to do, and in
addition there were some amendments and additions to be made to the CV
Register. I also discovered a packet containing some old Mullard Data Sheets
which needed to be put into the appropriate folder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Having completely reorganised
the cupboard in the loft, I made a point today of collecting together all the
Manuals and folders and fixing them into a folder. The other folders I put into
a filing box which Dr. Pover got me from Experimental Psychiatry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner I continued this
work, then went down to the Animal House to weight the cats. After tea I
completed a letter to my new-found friends of the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Apostolic</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Church</span><span lang=EN-GB> in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Margate</span><span lang=EN-GB> and went into the hospital to post
it. I came out of work at </span><span lang=EN-GB>five past five</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and was home within half an hour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>6.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> I called for Helen and we went to
the </span><span lang=EN-GB>West End</span><span lang=EN-GB> to see Ronald
Shiner in <i>Up To His Neck</i>. I hadn’t intended to go to a city centre
cinema so as not to be late, but not another cinema in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span
lang=EN-GB> has a good programme showing this week. In any case, we’re hardly
any later when we go to town than when we go to a local cinema, so it makes
little difference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            <i>Up To His Neck</i> was most
enjoyable, though it lacked the sparkle of <i>Worm’s Eye View</i> and <i>Reluctant
Heroes</i>. In it Ronald Shiner is a sailor in charge of a submarine which is
threatened by Chinese pirates. He is helped by a girl spy played by Laya Raki. Harry
Fowler, Brian Rix, Gerald Campion, Bryan Forbes and Colin Gordon were some of
the sailors. The supporting film <i>Ricochet Romance</i> was also quite
amusing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The usual kiss that Helen gives
me in the cinema was tonight quite the nicest yet. But I do wish Helen wouldn’t
ration me so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Pat Welch was sitting in the row
behind us tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Compared with yesterday I had
relatively little to do. Most of the morning I spent in the animal house. I
bathed Blackie’s eye. We had two fatalities. A guinea-pig died, and Scruffy the
dog mauled a kitten which got out of its run. The kitten died from shock a few
minutes later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I ate my lunch in the canteen
for the first time instead of in my office. In the afternoon I made a list of
the chemicals which appear in my file but not in the cupboards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Dennis Vaughan lent me his
racquet today and John and I played tennis from 12.30 until </span><span lang=EN-GB>1.45pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I was very much out of practice and one
of my better shots sailed into the air, over the net, out of the court, nearly
over the fence, down the embankment, and under a train.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I started a letter to David
Torvell today. We had the wood cut for the drawers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            As usual it has poured with
rain today [0.735 inches]. On my way to work I called in at school to see
whether the G.C.E. results had arrived. They hadn’t, so I left a postcard to be
posted on to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Before going to work I dropped
a letter in at Helen’s house, and at work I went into the Hospital and posted
my letter to David.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I didn’t have a tea-break all
day, and less than half an hour for dinner. I intended to get in some more
tennis practice but, of course, it was raining.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Surprise! This afternoon Dr.
Pover actually agreed to throw out many of the bottles etc. on the shelves in
the centre o the lab, so there was soon plenty of washing up. I also did some
counting for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Roy</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I had spent
the morning fitting the runners into the chest of drawers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I wrote a letter   [to

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The most important news today
is that I have passed “A” level Biology and Chemistry. It was a foregone
conclusion that I had failed Physics. I had an appointment at the dentist at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.30am</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Mr. Parker says I shall need to have a
tooth out on September 6th.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was going to wait until
tomorrow for my exam results, but on my way to work, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hammond</span><span
lang=EN-GB> met me on the 1A ’bus, so we went together to school and got the
results from Miss Davies. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hammond</span><span
lang=EN-GB> got three “A”s. In my delight at the results I quite forgot to find
whether Laurie Arthur had passed, or whether David had got his scholarship. Yet
another prayer is answered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was about </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB> when I got to work. I gave Bill Dunn
nearly two dozen reagent bottles</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I cycled to work today. I wrote
an article on Margate Old House and finished another article which I posted in the
Q.E. I was home by </span><span lang=EN-GB>12.45pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.
After dinner I cycled down the village. Ruth Prentice and Ronald Pendry were
married by Mr. Dibben at Church today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen and I went to the Theatre
Royal tonight to see <i>No News From Father</i>. It was rather good, a very
clever adaptation from the [space left] and starred Bernard Braden, Eleanor
Summerfield and Robin Bailey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We had seats X14 and 15 in the

“And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I took a Sunday school class

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was dull and overcast today
with a spattering of rain and not a glimmer of sunshine. Nothing much happened
at work; we thought of playing tennis in the lunch hour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I took Helen to the Robin
Hood to see <i>Highway Dragnet</i> (U) and<i> Happy Ever After</i> (U). The first
film was a thriller about a man given a lift by a lady photographer and trying
to prove his innocence of her murder. It was a good film, full of twists and
turns, and starred Joan Bennett, Richard Conte, and Wanda Hendrix. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The film I specially wanted to
see was <i>Happy Ever After</i> (U), a Technicolor comedy starring David Niven,
Yvonne de Carlo, A.E. Matthews and George Cole. It was about some Irish
villagers wanting to murder their horrid squire, and was very funny. It was an altogether
enjoyable evening and we were very romantic.</span></p>

been making enquiries, they have really felt the Holy Spirit at work.</span></p>

I played tennis during the lunch hour. Tonight I took Ginger for her walk up </span><span

suggesting a twenty-minutes film programme for Midland Children’s Hour. My
script is a ten-minute review of “films coming your way”, and the programme
would also include a record of film music, an interview, and Film News.</span></p>

last Sunday [except pencilled notes]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Summer seems to have come at
last. It’s been fine and sunny all day [10.6 hours of sunshine and 8.7
yesterday, today’s temperature reaching 71 degrees] and I cycled to work again.
At work I finished “Going the Rounds” and posted it off. I doubt whether my
idea will be acceptable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            More trouble for Michael! The
two kittens of the litter seem to have contracted pneumonia overnight, so we
gave sub-cutaneous injections of penicillin followed by procaine penicillin at
3 hour intervals, but one kitten was dead by </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>2.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. In the morning I also cleaned the
dark room after borrowing a mop and bucket from the kitchen. I also printed two
cards for the filing cabinet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner I did an experiment
to test the solubility of Silicone 200/200 in various organic reagents, and
emptied the radio-active waste bins. After tea I did some work on my book. I
was home for </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and in the
evening I took Helen to the Piccadilly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I particularly wanted to see <i>The
Sea Around Us</i> and it proved an excellent film. From its start, when it goes
right back to the beginning of time and shows how the earth and the oceans were
formed, it never ceases to fascinate. It opens up a new world of strange
creatures from the tiniest plankton to the largest whale, a world where the
struggle for survival is fought at its bitterest. We see how the oceans play
their part in the life of the world, a little of the story of the men who for
centuries have gone down to the sea in ships. Here is a film of wonder and
mystery, beautifully photographed in Technicolor, and skilfully pieced together
to make a first-rate documentary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The colour photography was
about the best part of <i>Dangerous Mission</i> set in the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Glacier</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>National
  Park</span><span lang=EN-GB> in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Canada</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. Piper Laurie plays the girl Vincent Price is trying to bump off
because she saw him murder somebody else. Victor Mature is the hero, and there
are also a couple of avalanches and a forest fire thrown in for good measure.
William Bendix was badly cast as a Ranger. On the whole, not too bad.     </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Today I had my Saturday off. I
got up at </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.15am</span><span lang=EN-GB>. There were
four letters for me today – my <i>Scripture Union</i> notes, S.T.A. Bulletin,
and two from the B.B.C. “Music from the Movies” goes on the air on September
20th. There was a 5 guinea cheque. Hooray for money! In the morning I went to
the Library and the Bank. Naturally the bank [to pay in the cheque: I have now
saved £9 8s 9d]. Apart from writing a letter I spent the rest of the morning on
my Diary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner Dad and I cycled
to Blues’ match v. Rotherham United. The teams were:–</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span></b><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Rotherham</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB>
United</span></b><span lang=EN-GB>:– Quairney; Selkirk, Johnson; Marshall,
Noble, Williams; Grainger, Henderson, Burke, Guest, Wilson.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Blues’ new stand was in use for
the first time. There was also a new-style programme with a view of the ground
on the cover. The secretary referred to it as a catalogue!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            </span><span lang=EN-GB>Rotherham</span><span
lang=EN-GB> were a goal up in 45 seconds. A great gaping hole [in the defence]
left Guest with a clear shot at goal and he shot high and wide of </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Merrick</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Blues had more of the first-half
play and some of their Hungarian-style passing was very good, but they dallied
in front of goal, and the quick-tackling </span><span lang=EN-GB>Rotherham</span><span
lang=EN-GB> defence prevented Blues scoring. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Merrick</span><span
lang=EN-GB> had to make some good saves at the other end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Just after the interval Govan
scored with a low shot that went under Quairney’s body, and added another four
minutes later with a header. Warhurst scored a third goal for Blues and they won
3-1.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The preacher at both today’s
services was Rev. D.S. Hubery whom I remembered especially well from a previous
visit to our Church. I liked both his sermons, and particularly this morning’s
on Galatians 1:4, “Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from
this present evil world, according to the will of God and the Father.” Mr.
Hubery said we needed to be delivered from fear and sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight the text was 1 Corinthians
15:1-2, “I declare unto you the gospel … by which also ye are saved.” Had we
anything to declare? To ourselves? To others? To God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I took a Sunday School class
(Iris’s, she has ’flu) this afternoon. Two of Helen’s cousins were in the
class. I wonder whether there are such things as cousins-in-law?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We said special prayers at
Church for Mrs. Pardoe Snr., who is very seriously ill and is to have an
operation. We also prayed specially for the World Council of Churches meeting
in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Evanston</span><span lang=EN-GB> in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Canada</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was Helen’s last Sunday at
Church for some time. How I shall miss her. The thought made me quite unhappy
all day until this evening when we could go for a walk together. And then as
usual, Helen’s own wonderful way of making me happy when she is with me worked
again. We talked about all sorts of little things we would do for each other …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We got talking about the very
first time we spoke to each other. How it took me four weeks to hold her hand,
seven weeks to kiss her, and even longer till the next time I kissed her. And,
of course, all the time Helen wanted me to kiss her but was much too shy to let
me. She is not so shy now and even gave me a goodnight kiss outside her house.
[After Church] we walked along St. Bernard’s Road, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Streetsbrook
  Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> (where I saw Chris Tickell and Dr. Gough) and </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Shirley Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Nothing much happened at work
today except that I revised the results of an experiment from last February.
Here a faecal count for </span><span lang=EN-GB>12.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>
on the first day gave a 12.5% recovery. This must have been due to urine
contamination, so I revised the results, re-typed them and drew new graphs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I typed several pages of my
play “The Shilgally Serpent”. I wish I knew how to end it now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I came home at </span><span lang=EN-GB>five past six</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen went to the Fittons for
tea, so I couldn’t see her on this our last evening until </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.45pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. We had only a few minutes during which we
walked down </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dolphin Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB> [to </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Warwick Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>] and back up </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Victoria Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>. There was such a lot I
wanted to say but the words just wouldn’t come. I think Helen knew how I felt
but she could only make some trite remark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had three letters today. One
from the B.B.C. was to acknowledge receipt of “Going the Rounds” and to say
that “Music from the Movies” has been postponed. B.D.H. Ltd. have sent me three
very useful booklets, and the third letter was from the Methodist Youth
Department – three copies of <i>Youth</i> containing my article “My Side of the
Mike”. This has been illustrated with a photo of a B.B.C. studio broadcasting a
Billy Bunter scene.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            During the day I made a bottom
of two pieces of wood for a filing drawer I am using for my letters. I also
wrote to Helen, and made yup two tanks of solutions (ID.19b and a 1.7% solution
of Glacial Acetic Acid). This was rather difficult as I had a job getting the
right amounts of chemicals. For one solution alone I require 10kgm Sodium
Thiosulphate which the stores doesn’t possess, even AnalaR [sic]. That reminds
me that Bill Dunn is leaving at the end of this week. Apparently I shalln’t be
going to the General Hospital until next week as there would be no work for me
to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I spent the whole evening
filing my letters and discovered my long-lost long-playing gramophone record
needles in the process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            All day long I was thinking
about Helen. She went back [to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dudley</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> yesterday] at </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. She got up early to catch a train [from
Banbury] to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stratford</span><span lang=EN-GB> before </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB>, and thinking about her, I myself was awake
before </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB>. When I went to
bed again I kept tossing and turning and wondering whether Helen was sleeping
on her first night back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The last few days have been
very fine and the sun was shining again when I woke this morning. [We had 12.3
hours of sunshine yesterday and the temperature reached 76 degrees; today it
has reached 80, making it the hottest day since 12th August last year.]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Today’s correspondence included
a letter from Mr. Lunt and a card from the O.E.F.G. whose postponed Annual
General Meeting is being held on the 11th at </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>6.45pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I cycled to work. </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Cannon</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hill</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Park</span><span lang=EN-GB> looked
beautiful with the dew still on the grass and the sun peeping through the
leaves. The morning was still cool and fresh, but on this first day of
September the leaves are already beginning to fall and the first signs of Autumn
are already in evidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Nevertheless today has been the
hottest of the year with the temperature up in the 80s [80 maximum in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span lang=EN-GB>]. I spent the lunch hour lying
on the lawns by the goldfish pond. One of the girls wanted to throw me in. As
it was, I got ice-cream slapped in my face at tea!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Altogether it’s been a chaotic
day at work. First I was going to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Augustus Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, then Dr. Pover said he would go. Then this afternoon we were both
going but then we had a visitor and we didn’t go after all. </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Augustus Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> has got the Hypo I want for
my photographic solutions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            On top of all that, the </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I cycled to work again this
morning and took my swimming trunks so that I could go for a swim in the school
bath. It was fine again but not so hot, and I didn’t go swimming after all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At long last the Hypo solution

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I achieved a minor ambition
today because the <i>Birmingham Weekly Post</i> printed an article of mine,
“The Old House at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Margate</span><span lang=EN-GB>” in
Peter Hazlitt’s “Notes and Queries”. Now I’ve written, or been written about,
in all the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Midland</span><span lang=EN-GB> newspapers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At work I spent the morning
discussing religion with </span><span lang=EN-GB>Roy</span><span lang=EN-GB>,
and the afternoon counting the first samples of a new patient. As I had cycled
to work I got home for </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.
As Helen was coming home I thought we might go out but she was still not home
at </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I did see her at </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and we went a walk for an hour. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I’ve missed Helen terribly all
the week and was disappointed when we couldn’t go out. After worrying about her
all the time and having to put up with constant reminders that she is going to
be a nurse and a spinster all her life. I was rather frantic tonight and
shouted at her when she said she had to be back within an hour. I could see
then that I had hurt her and wished, not for the first time in my life, that I
could keep my big mouth shut. I was so sorry afterwards. But we did talk about
the things that were on my mind, and Helen did say she had <i>not</i> decided
never to get married, and she <i>did</i> still want me to take her out.</span></p>

<p class=topic><span lang=EN-GB>The call to serve</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Today was really my last day in
the Radiochemistry laboratory. At </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.0am</span><span
lang=EN-GB> Dr. Sammons brought in three urine samples – the rest of the time I
worked out the results of yesterday’s work. The patient is a normal one. I may
go into work one evening next week and type the results. Dr. Pover says I can
use the typewriter any evening I like to. I said Goodbye to Dr. Pover and Roy
and came home at </span><span lang=EN-GB>12.45pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Every minute I was thinking of
Helen who was bridesmaid to her cousin Pat at Shottery. Pat and Mike got
married at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Shottery</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Church</span><span lang=EN-GB> at </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>12.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Helen must have looked so
beautiful – I do wish I could have seen her but, of course, the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>General</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span
lang=EN-GB> would have to complicate everything. However, God willing, perhaps
I shall have Helen looking just as beautiful at a very special Wedding just for
us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had an unexpected letter this
morning from Mr. Dibben saying that the Local Preachers’ Meeting has approved
the suggestion that I be given a “Note to Preach” and for a trial period to
assist an accredited preacher in taking service. Suddenly I feel wholly
unworthy and incapable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I spent the afternoon mowing
the front lawn – it hadn’t been done since before we went on holiday. Midway
through the afternoon two women Jehovah’s Witnesses called at our house. Later,
they tried to give me a pamphlet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen didn’t arrive back until </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> when she came round to tell me she was
home again. She <i>did</i> look beautiful. At </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>ten past nine</span><span lang=EN-GB> I called for her to take her
back to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dudley Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>. She was
rather upset so I was glad I could be with her. We went on the 1A ’bus to town,
then caught the 84 ’bus. Once or twice I thought she would cry but she didn’t.
I think that what Helen fears most is the solitude when she has closed the door
of her room. I can understand exactly how she feels. I feel it myself even
though I’m not actually there. Loneliness must be the most terrible human
emotion there is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            There is something about a
hospital at the dead of night. A sense of isolation from the world, a place
where time seems different somehow, where for some time has ceased to matter,
or for others, has acquired some new sense of urgency, a place where many a
battle is fought in the quiet and stillness of the dark hours, where always
there is someone on duty, always a light burning. And above all, perhaps, there
is a sense of the nearness of God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            These were some of the thoughts
that ran through my mind as I walked back through the hospital grounds after
saying Goodbye again. But there was something else though which even now I
can’t analyse, a sort of realisation that this was Helen’s way of serving God,
and that anything I could do could never approach such service as she is
giving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I walked all the way back into
town, down Spring Hill, the Sand Pits, the Parade, past sleazy back streets,
squalid little back-to-back houses, little groups of people huddled on corners,
past Public Houses with their depressing atmosphere, and beer swilling the
pavements, people singing and drinking in their attempts to escape from life.
And as I registered all these impressions I was left with a sense of pity,
remorse and revulsion; yet through all these I could feel God’s presence. Above
all, I knew more than ever how much I loved Helen and wanted to give her all
the best things in life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Brice took this morning’s
service. The hymns were 680 <i>Glad was my heart to hear</i>, 6* <i>Jubilate
Deo</i>, 845 <i>God make my life a little light</i>, 549 <i>Lord, that I may
learn of Thee</i>, and 102 <i>Immortal Love, for ever full</i>, and the
readings were Isaiah 15 ? 35] and Titus 2:11-15.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben took the service
tonight. We sang 689 <i>At even, ere the sun was set </i>(which depresses me
because of its mournful tune), 60* <i>Psalm 139:1-12</i>, 342 <i>Come, let us
to the Lord our God</i>, 577 <i>O loving Lord, who art for ever seeking</i>,
and 945 <i>The night is come, wherein at last we rest</i>. The readings were
from Daniel 5:1 [probably verses 1-7] and Matthew 22.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After the service I stayed for
Holy Communion.</span></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal'>            I
received a hand-delivered letter from Helen which she started on Saturday night
an hour after I left her and continued yesterday when she felt in the mood for
thinking about me. Did I find my way out? She was in bed and had already spent
several minutes reading her Bible and the S.U. Notes (which she knows will
please me). She says that truthfully she is missing me, and felt she could have
gone on for ever with her hand on mine on the ’bus, but she must stop herself
from being so silly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            She kept thinking it was Monday
tomorrow. I was going to Church wasn’t I? Please would I give Freda her love,
not all of it, and tell her she was sorry for not writing but will write soon
and one day this week will ring her up. She was going to say her prayers now
and go to sleep. Good night. X</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            (Sunday.) She must go on duty in
a few minutes but wishes me Good morning. She wishes she could see me now. She
honestly doesn’t know what to think about nursing – she misses her home life so
very much. Helen says that it is now </span><span lang=EN-GB>10.0am</span><span
lang=EN-GB> roughly and she has got the morning off duty. She expects that when
I get this letter she will have seen me first, and can I guess why? It is
because she has another day off tomorrow [today, Monday]. She has just rung her
mother up and she expects that David will give or have given me her message. She
won’t write more as she will see me tonight.</span></p>

D.V. one day we will be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had another letter from Helen
this morning. We have now exchanged six letters in five days which must be
nearly a record. In her letter Helen said she didn’t know whether to go home or
got out with me tomorrow. I guessed something like that would happen and more
or less remarked so in my letter yesterday. The trouble was I had already sent
a note of apology to the O.E.F.C. to say I couldn’t attend their General Meeting
tomorrow night, which I would have attended had I not made a date for tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I rang Helen up four times
during the day. Twice there was no answer, the third time she was on duty, but at
the fourth attempt we managed to talk to each other for half an hour, and did
decide that we would go out together tomorrow night as we had originally
intended. Helen sounded terribly depressed and said she wasn’t going to stop
three years. To cheer her up, I said I would ’phone again at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            When I did ring again I was
told that Helen was at home. And then, instead of going round to her house, I
waited instinctively [intuitively] opposite the [31A] ’stop, knowing full well
she would be on the next ’bus, though there was no reason why she should be. It
is strange how I get these feelings of knowing exactly what Helen is doing,
especially when she does the unexpected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            She had to go back of course at
</span><span lang=EN-GB>10pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>, so I had supper with the
Walkers before taking her back to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dudley Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. We waited half an hour before a 31A ’bus came and Helen was almost
frantic with worry, and in tears, but no amount of worrying could help. We got
in at 11.10 just as someone was unlocking the door to get in! It was a good
thing I could take her back though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>             I started for work later than
usual this morning but got there a little bit earlier. When I got in “house”
the cleaner had her feet up in my favourite chair and was sitting in the other
one. She whistled between her teeth something about my not minding but she
always had her lunch there but she would go (she did three quarters of an hour
later) but she might come back (she didn’t). What a character!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I spent the whole afternoon
working on my book, “Give Us This Day”. I now have well over half the texts I require,
but selecting the hymn verses will present the biggest problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen and I went to the Odeon
tonight but somehow it wasn’t a very happy evening. We arranged to meet between
</span><span lang=EN-GB>6.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and 6.10, but when Helen
arrived at </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.20pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> after being
on the wards all day she was tired out. We had to wait in an enormous queue but
got in for the start at </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.10pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The first film, <i>The Golden
Link</i> (A), a murder mystery with Andre Morell, Thea Gregory and Patrick Holt
was rather depressing. The film everyone had queued to see was <i>Living It Up</i>
(U) with Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Janet Leigh. Jerry Lewis thinks he has
been accidentally poisoned with radium and so becomes the focus of nationwide
attention and sympathy. It was quite funny in parts but knowing that Helen had
to be back at the hospital tonight meant we couldn’t enjoy it properly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:16.0pt'>          </span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>We raced off to catch the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dudley Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB> ’bus and I felt it had been a hopeless evening. Helen had looked so
drawn and tired that it quite upset me. At the ’bus stop I suddenly felt I was
making a hopeless mess of everything and ruining Helen’s career. She saw the
tears in my eyes and put her arm consolingly round me, and when we got to the
Hospital she said she did need me but couldn’t know anything definite yet. But
she also said everything would come right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I feel certain that Helen was
meant to be a nurse yet it seems all wrong to me that because of petty
regulations and stupid organisation she should have to give up all the little
things in life. The time off is either useless, or she is too tired to make use
of it, or she has to worry about being back in time. It seems especially wrong
that she can’t come to Church on Sunday, and on Christmas Day and Good Friday
in particular. Paradoxically enough, the time I miss Helen most is when I’m not
used to having her right by my side, in Church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Are we never to enjoy these
little things again together, walking in the countryside, listening to the
stillness of the evening, glorying in a wonderful sunset? Or is this only a
temporary parting? I wish I knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=topic><span lang=EN-GB>An excellent sermon</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got home just after </span><span lang=EN-GB>midnight</span><span lang=EN-GB> and slept till ten this morning. I was
tired out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At Church this morning we had
Rev. E. Bryan Harvey, whose sermon was on 1 Corinthians 2:16: “For who hath
known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of
Christ.” What a man thinks determines what he is; the power of mind over matter
therefore wins. What are the attributes of the mind of Christ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>1. It is focussed</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> on the immediate. It displays great alertness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>2. It is not afraid</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> of being [antagonised ? illegible]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>3. It is capable</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> of almost impossible optimism, of accomplishments great beyond exaggeration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Whatever the circumstances we must never
despair, for all things are possible unto God. This is the mind of Christ which
we possess.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We sang 670 <i>Jesus, Thou soul
of all our joys</i>, 2* <i>Te Deum Laudamus</i>, 857 <i>God has given us a Book
full of stories</i>, 721 <i>Jesus, united by Thy grace</i>, and 562 <i>God of
all power, and truth, and grace</i>. The lessons were from Daniel 3:19-30 and
Romans 1:1-17.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            During the day I wrote to
Helen. She said she might be home during the afternoon but wasn’t.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben took tonight’s
service. We sang 668 <i>Angel voices, ever singing</i>, 63* <i>Psalm 148</i>,
92 <i>Jesus! The name high over all</i>, 705 <i>God is the refuge of His saints</i>,
and 945 <i>The night is come, wherein at last we rest</i>. The lessons were
Proverbs 12:1-16 and Matthew 7:1-12.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The sermon was on Matthew 7:6,
“Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before
swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.” This
is very important – we are told not to judge yet here is a criticism. Who are
the dogs? They are people who despise the Truth and would destroy those who
bring it. The Gospel is holy and very precious, therefore we must be careful
with whom we share it. The text does not mean that we are not to witness to
Truth or protest at un-Christian deeds etc. Our witness is to glorify God, that
is our purpose. There is a difference between criticism and judgment. We are
not to criticise, not to try to remove the splinter from someone’s eye when we
have a plank in our own, but we must judge who are our opponents. We are to
love our enemies. “As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
likewise.” (Luke 6:31). We must:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>1.</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> Respect
all men even though we believe them to be wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>2.</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> Allow each
to follow his own way; if they are wrong they will have problems sooner or
later and will learn by their mistakes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>3.</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> It was
the totally unsympathetic whom Jesus referred to as dogs and swine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>To ask someone “Are you saved?” is not
always the best approach. We must be judicious in our witnessing for God. There
is a time for witnessing and a time for restraint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was an excellent sermon and
very helpful.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>This sermon has remained with me all my
life and has been of inestimable value in a ministry which has taken us to many
lands and has encountered much hostility. Mr. Dibben, himself a former
missionary to India, recognised my call to the ministry and did everything
possible to assist and encourage me, and his influence remains with me to this
day. In retrospect. many of his sermons seem specially designed to help me. In
any case, he would see me sitting below him in the third or fourth pew scribbling
down these notes which I now decipher over half a century later. I salute all
those clergy, ministers and pastors who have contributed to my life, and Mr.
Dibben above all. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a dreadful day at work. I
cleaned the poor animals [guinea-pigs, all to be killed so that their guts can
be used in experiments], broke a bottle, had trouble with the organ bath, and
upset everybody. I loathe having to do this job. I didn’t even write to Helen
after the stupid disagreement we have had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            When I got home this evening
there was a letter for me from Helen which she obviously wrote in bed this
morning. She says:–</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Dearest Brian,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I am terribly sorry about
Sunday night. Will you believe me when I say that I didn’t mean to do it? I
don’t know what gets into me sometimes. Please forgive me, will you? That means
forgetting the incident as well …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Did you not ring me for
punishment, yesterday? When I see you on Friday I promise I will let you kiss
me if you still wish to. I feel though that a little thing like that shouldn’t
make you feel that you never want to see me again. I am sorry, and my heart is
very sad. Each morning I dread the day. I shan’t stay for three years. I think
I would rather be with you … x x x x x x x</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I am always finding new and
loveable qualities in Helen, more and more each day I feel she was meant for
me, even if she does hurt me sometimes without realising it. Now I know that I
love her more than ever. But I do hop[e she will stay the three years and get
her S.R.N. but I am sure she will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Having had a bad day of
constant backache I went to bed at </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.30pm</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and wrote to Helen to say I had forgiven her even as I went to bed
on Sunday night, and I wasn’t trying to punish her when I didn’t phone on
Monday. I wasn’t able to phone today as Helen was only off-duty during the
afternoon, and she had already arranged to meet Freda in town at </span><span lang=EN-GB>2.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was a tedious sort of day at
work. I was busy all morning doing odd jobs. In the afternoon, when I tried to
get my organ-bath to function, everything seemed to go wrong and I didn’t make
much progress. One thing I did get done was phone Phillip Harris Ltd. And ask
them to come and remove a large number of bottles and Winchesters that are
littering the lab and cluttering up the passage. After some considerable delay
I was told they would probably be collected tomorrow. I’m a bit doubtful but
perhaps I shall succeed where all the others have failed.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>Helen wrote the letter in bed this morning.
It was collected either from the pillar box on the corner of Shirley Road and
Olton Boulevard East or the Post Office down the village; it was postmarked “Birmingham

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I must learn to keep my big
mouth shut. The pain in my back was at its worst this morning, and when I tried
to lift a box into which I had piled all Phillip Harris’s bottles, my back gave
way and I had to try to balance the box on the step, unable to lift it up or
down. One of the bottlers smashed, and when I asked Hilary to come and help me,
Alan said something, I lost my temper, picked up my coat, and walked out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to work as usual this

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I ’phoned Dr. Gough but
couldn’t speak to him as he is ill, then I ’phoned the Q.E.H. and had to ring
them back at </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.00pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I rang </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Dudley Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> to talk to Helen but there was
no answer, but later I ’phoned again and did speak to her. We arranged to go
for a walk tomorrow night. I made a sixth ’phone call to Phillip Harris’s to
remind them they were collecting some bottles yesterday. They would call
tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I did an experiment during the

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to the Q.E.H. Casualty
Department today, and after an hour and a half I underwent another complete
examination, after which the doctor gave me a letter to take to take to the
Physiotherapy Department at the General. I called in at </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Medical</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>School</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and met D.W.G. Budd [Medical VI] who had brought in his G.C.E.
certificates as he has an interview as a prospective student next week. I remember
my interview … On the way to the Hospital I met P.J.I. Connop [Medical
Division] who also has to face the same ordeal on Tuesday and was glad to have
my advice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got into town at </span><span lang=EN-GB>12.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and collected my pay from the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Edmund Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> offices [of the University].
I ate my dinner in the lab then went out again to see if I could get fixed in
with a Physics class at College. Nothing doing there, so it looks like Botany
and Zoology classes there, Physics at Aston or Handsworth technical College and
Chemistry by myself. Or something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            When I got back to Hospital I
went down to Physiotherapy, had a card made out for me, and had twenty-five
minutes heat treatment, but it did nothing to remove the pain. Funnily enough,
the only time I haven’t had the pain today was when I was being pinned,
thumped, and generally knocked about in the Q.E.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was comforting though, to be
able to relax and feel the heat of the lamp on my back. I was in Ward 22, and
there were other “invalids” learning to walk, doing exercises, or having the
same treatment as me. All very interesting. When I got back to the lab I
cleaned out the animals and tidied up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Helen was home tonight and we
went to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Solihull</span><span lang=EN-GB> on the ’bus,
then down </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hampton Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB> and </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Marsh Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Helen is a tease sometimes!
Waiting for the ’bus back she gave me a certain look and said “You never do
what I want you to.” Wonder what it was?!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had my Saturday off this
morning and spent an hour and a half shop window gazing in the village. Only
104 days to go to Christmas … I got <i>88 More Stories</i> by Guy de Maupassant
from the Library. The rest of the family went to Yarningale, so I was alone all
day till I saw Helen at </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We walked to </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Grange Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> and back through Olton. I
don’t know what started it but we started talking about what love does to
people. Helen hasn’t admitted it, but didn’t deny that she <i>is</i> worrying,
if only sub-consciously, about not knowing what she feels about me. I wish I
knew. It’s agonising being madly in love with someone who doesn’t know how she
feels about you. I still feel God had some Purpose when He brought us together,
as He surely did. Can it really be coincidence that the deeper things in life
mean so much to us both, that we can share the same joys, and have so many
things in common, while still differing on some things sufficiently enough to
prevent our becoming dead bores to each other? The trouble is, I can’t imagine
how any girl could love me; but if we leave things to God, all will be well.</span></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>SUNDAY 19th SEPTEMBER</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The preacher at this morning’s
service was one of the two new Circuit ministers, Rev. Henry E. Foss. His text
was Galatians 5:1, “Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath
made us free”, and answered many of my questions, or rather gave me the answer
to many of the questions I get asked. Mr. Foss said that man was born to be
free but was not able to be free. Without safeguards freedom could lead to licence,
and this to anarchy. Freedom of thought, speech and conduct led to frustration
and a craving for authority. Many nowadays don’t know what to believe. They had
misguided ideas, e.g. ideas that science and religion are contradictory. There
was a craving for a final authority which people could believe, not just
accept, Some (e.g. the Roman Catholics) took the Church as the final authority,
others (e.g. Jehovah’s Witnesses) took the Bible as the final authority. What
then was the truth? When had we found it? True belief was based on an internal
conviction, not on an external authority. The Church might be divided in some
ways, but in many ways it is very united. Each tries to express what it feel is
true. What was in line with God’s teaching was true, and we should always seek
the guidance of the Holy Spirit, remembering that the Spirit has never left us,
and that we should pray with our eyes open and our ears unstopped. We could be
sure our faith was the right one when the teaching of Christ, the witness of
the Bible, and the inner guidance of the Spirit all agreed. This was the real
truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was a very good service. We
sang 44 <i>The spacious firmament on high</i>, 5* <i>Benedictus</i>, 849 <i>Father,
lead me day by day</i>, 160 <i>Thou art the way: to Thee alone</i>, and 630 <i>O
grant us light, that we may know</i>. The readings were Genesis 4:1-15 and
James 1:12-27.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight the Youth Team
conducted the service at </span><span lang=EN-GB>South Yardley</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. Freda led, Rosemary and Monica read, and Jos Pardoe, Pat Welch and
I spoke on “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and for ever.” I spoke
second, and referred to notes I made this afternoon. What I really said was,
Jesus is still the same, still delivers us from sin, suffering, fear; therefore
don’t worry. Cast all your cares upon Him. I do try to practice what I preach.
I was so caught up by the Spirit, I felt happy for the first time for ages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The hymns we chose were 245 <i>Hail
to the Lord’s Anointed</i>, 716 <i>Thou God of truth and love</i>, 349 <i>Jesus,
if still the same Thou art</i>, 320 <i>Art thou weary, art thou languid</i>,
and 182 <i>When I survey the wondrous Cross</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At Y.P.F. I gave an impromptu
talk on music (with records). Brian Sharpe and Lionel Hubbard also spoke.

Schneider hasn’t been in at all, but we’ve had Janet, and Alan’s other
girl-friend (one of them), a new technician from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Iraq</span><span
lang=EN-GB> who will be with us for a fortnight – I think his name is Ahmed
Ali, or something – and Pam was a visitor this morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Pam is having a baby soon, so
it’s not surprising that babies were the main topic of conversation. I don’t
know who brought up the question of names, but someone said <i>Helen</i> was a
lovely name, and Pam looked at me, and I was very nearly embarrassed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went for my heat treatment at

suddenly felt that Helen would be coming home and we could go to the cinema, so
I came home at ten to five. When I got home Mam said that Mrs. Walker wanted to
tell me that Helen would be home tonight, but hadn’t been able to tell me
yesterday as I was at </span><span lang=EN-GB>South Yardley</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. It’s funny how I seem to know these things. In my letter to Helen
today I nearly put “I shall see you tonight” as a P.S., but put another one
instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was invited to the Sharpe’s
house in St. Bernard’s Road last night and I went at 8pm. Donald Holloway was
there too, and with Brian Sharpe we sang our trio from <i>The Mikado</i> [“I am
so proud, if I allowed”] which we hope to sing at the “Harvest Home” on
Saturday night. Bob Pardoe helped us learn our parts. I am singing Pish-Tush.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was very busy at work today.
I defrosted the ’fridge in the morning and in the afternoon washed up, packed
the laundry basket and got everything set up for an experiment tomorrow. Mr.
George Watts was back today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a letter from Helen this
morning. She is going to make sure she gets Sunday evening off so that we can
be together at the Harvest Festival, it is all she is living for at the moment,
but after another week she will be in the class room with regular times. For the
next four weeks she will have every Friday evening off, all day Saturday,
Sunday from </span><span lang=EN-GB>2pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and Wednesday
evenings. On Tuesday night Staff Nurse Morries took her round with Nurse Knight
(a junior) administering medicines and injections. Helen isn’t well though –
she has had a terrible headache for three days, has strained her shoulder and
is obviously worried about her mother and David, who has been in hospital.
However, Val persuaded her to play table-tennis for half-an-hour, and she was
sitting in the lounge in the sun to write the letter. She thoroughly enjoyed
Monday night, and is looking forward to Sunday night, as I am too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to Church tonight for a
run-through of the concert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At work today I fed the animals
and polished the benches and finished the washing up. I stayed until 12.0
working on my book and I continued this when I got home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>4.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> I called at Pardoes’ [</span><span
  lang=EN-GB>48 Shirley Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>] to have a rehearsal of
our trio. Bob hadn’t arrived then so I went over to the Church to see if I
could find Brian or Donald. Mrs. Walker was there, she had just taken Helen
back to the ’bus. I could have seen Helen as I knew she would be home for 3.0,
and I did wait to see if she was on the 31A ’bus before taking Ginger [for] a
walk down the village. Perhaps it was a good thing, as she cried a lot when she
did get home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mrs. Walker was understandably
a little put out when she was not invited to help prepare the Harvest Supper as
she has always done for years. I myself would have been more than a little
hurt, but Mrs. Walker was equanimitous about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>        </span></b><span

Sunday School Gift Service at </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.0pm</span><span
lang=EN-GB> when Mr. Dibben and his Indian friend Mr. Hermit sang together in

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I’ve done enough needless
running around today to last for ages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After morning coffee I came out
of work to go to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Handsworth</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Technical</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>College</span><span
lang=EN-GB> to see if I could make some arrangements to do a course in Physics
and Chemistry. I had to see a Mr. Vernon at </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>11.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB> and I had a talk with him. I could
do a Chemistry class there on Mondays from 11.20 till 12.30 and 1.45 till </span><span lang=EN-GB>2.50pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>, and Physics on Tuesday evenings from 7.0
till </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. These are special
classes for students retaking the A level examinations, but the syllabus is for
the [University of] </span><span lang=EN-GB>London</span><span lang=EN-GB>
exam. Mr. Vernon advised me to try to get fixed up with classes for the
Northern [Universities] exam at Aston.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At Aston I was told I would
need to do the full course which would have amounted to six classes a week
(they have no revision course) and this would have left no time for Botany and
Zoology classes at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Suffolk Street</span><span
lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Next I went to the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>College</span><span lang=EN-GB> of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Technology</span><span
lang=EN-GB> where I had a talk with Mrs. Moore and arranged to do a Botany
class on Monday evenings and Zoology on Thursday evenings. It was mid-afternoon
by the time I got back to G.H.B so I didn’t go for my treatment in
Physiotherapy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was a bit fed-up by the time
I got back home this evening. After tea I had a bath and felt much better.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tomorrow evening there is a <i>Music
You Love</i> Concert at the Town Hall, and as I shall not be doing a College
class (I haven’t decided what to do yet) I thought I should like to take Helen
to it. After listening to Part 4 of <i>Journey Into Space</i> I went to the
Walkers to leave a message, but there was no one in. I tried again later, then
decided to ’phone Helen herself at Dudley Road, but the line was engaged though
I tried at least a dozen times in three quarters of an hour. As the Walkers
were still out I left a message asking Mrs. Walker to ask Helen to meet me at
the Town Hall between 6.45 and </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.30pm</span><span
lang=EN-GB> tomorrow. If Helen rang up, that was!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got to work early this
morning and had a ’phone call from Helen at about 9.45am. She did want to go to
the concert and would meet me as arranged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            During the lunch hour I went to
the <i>Mail</i> offices and had a look at the posters to see what items were
being played at the Concert this evening, but the only announcement was that
the soloist in Beethoven’s <i>Emperor</i> Concerto was Clive Lythgoe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>1.45pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> I went down to Ward 22 and had some
new treatment for my back – heat massage and more heat. I am still having a lot
of pain but the massage seemed to help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I left work at five, came home
for tea and was back in town by </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.30pm</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. Helen met me twenty minutes later, and the concert began at 7.30.
The programme was:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Overture, <i>William Tell</i>,
Rossini</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            <i>Valse Triste</i>, Op. 44,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Rudolf Schwarz was conductor, and Clive Lythgoe
the soloist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Although there were but half a dozen

already booked and we had almost the last available seats there, C70 and 71.</span></p>

we had a lecture about a Vacuum Embedding Bath. After a break we did practical
work on the demonstration of iron in tissues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to school and saw Mr.
Balance who says he will enter me for the N.U.J.M.B. exams. So now I intend to
do the </span><span lang=EN-GB>London</span><span lang=EN-GB> revision classes
at Handsworth. This seems to be the most satisfactory plan, all things
considered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I also talked to Mr. Gosling
and a lot of my friends who always gather round when I appear, and, as today,
sometimes ask my advice. Jean also asked my advice at the I.M.L.T. class
earlier in the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            As I was talking to Mr.
Craddock [Henry Craddock, school porter] until </span><span

work for my lunch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Miss Jahn massaged my back at </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and by the time she had finished I felt a

this morning I spent an hour working on my book. Louie told me an interesting
(to me, anyway) story of the many different jobs she’s done in her life, of how
she and her husband worked the canals for many years. Louie obviously knows
every inch of our inland waterways. How true it is that the ordinary common folk,
the man in the street, sees more and knows most of what life is. The most
interesting folk are always those of humble circumstance, it seems to me.</span></p>

couldn’t get the card I wanted though I went everywhere in town. Then, luckily,
I went down the village to renew my library book and to buy a Biro refill for
Grandad, and there in Gills’ was just the card I wanted. It said <i>A Prayer

appointment at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB> this
morning. Mr. Parker did two permanent fillings. Mr. Parker was telling me how
he has been partially deaf since a patient spat blood at him one day as he was
doing an extraction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At work (I arrived at 10.45) I
did all my usual jobs and tried to do an experiment, but the ileum I was using
was Wednesday’s and contracted but would not expand. A flask containing a
carefully standardised solution broke in the refrigerator. I came home at </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I called for Helen at </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> – she had only just got home – and we went
to the Robin Hood, getting in at </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.10pm</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Since that one Sunday a month
ago I hadn’t been able to kiss Helen once, but we did exchange kisses tonight.
Helen does amuse me sometimes: she obviously likes being kissed but she still
won’t let me kiss her properly, or at least she is too shy to put an arm round
me and let me do the rest. On the back row the couple behind us seemed to have
overcome that major problem. I don’t think they saw much of the film at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            As I held Helen close to me I
loved her terribly and felt as I always do, that she is the only girl in the
world</span><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'> </span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>for me. I never felt quite so certain of that as I did when we
walked home together. We talked about all sorts of things, but one or two
things Helen said made me even more convinced she was meant for me. I didn’t
before realise how strongly she felt about such things as the Death Penalty,
about which I myself have such definite views.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            There is so much in common
between us, the same sort of ambition, ideals, principles and faith, and a
common understanding of what constitutes the highest, truest way of living,
that I cannot for one moment believe that it wasn’t a Divine Providence which
brought us together for always. If only Helen knew she loved me and realised
God meant her for me, I should be the happiest man on earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The film we went to see was <i>Dial
M for Murder</i> (A) with Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings, in
Warnercolor and originally in 3-D. It was a gripping film, adapted from the
play by Frederick Knott and directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The other film was <i>The
Red Dress</i> (A).</span></p>

157 <i>Jesus calls us! O’er the tumult</i>, and 378 <i>Eternal Sun of

15:1-3, 11-32.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben preached tonight. We
sang 17 <i>Meet and right it is to sing</i>, 58 <i>The Lord Jehovah reigns</i>,
432 <i>Hark, my soul! It is the Lord</i>, 615 <i>Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah</i>,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mondays are more than a little
tiring but at least I do see a bit more life than in the confines of the
Bio-Assay Laboratory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            When I got to Handsworth for
the Chemistry class I had to go and see the Principal as I haven’t paid up
another £1 16s. I finished my analysis for which I got 100%. I also got 100%
for each of two preps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Peter, Dave and I went up the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Soho Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> in the lunch hour and had a
riotous time together. Today we looked up all the pretty girls they knew in
that part. There should have been one in a hardware shop according to Pete, so
we all trooped in, but unfortunately (for Pete) a very old and wrinkled woman
came to serve him and he had to buy 3d. worth of nuts and bolts; and in the
meanwhile, the young lady in question came from the back of the shop to ask me,
“Can I help you, Sir?” I don’t know how we kept a straight face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At the sweet shop we were
rather more fortunate, and after debating whether we could legitimately ask for
¼ oz. of Dolly Mixtures, Dave bought us each a 1d. roll of liquorice which we
ate on the way back to College. A welcome bit of light relief!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Back at work I had nearly an
hour’s treatment on my back, then I cleaned out the animals, finished a letter
to Helen, and went to my Botany class. We studied the Morphology of the Root.
In practical we had to draw carrots. As I was hungry I ate mine. We also
learned how to use microscopes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Dr. Schneider sent me home at </span><span lang=EN-GB>2.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> telling me to go and see Dr. Gough. From a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            In the middle of the afternoon
Mrs. Walker rang me to say she hadn’t been able to get through to Helen so
there was no way of making arrangements to go to a cinema tonight. We had quite
an interesting and helpful conversation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I called for Helen at </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and we walked to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Solihull</span><span

and back via </span><span lang=EN-GB>Streetsbrook Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>.
In </span><span lang=EN-GB>Solihull</span><span lang=EN-GB> we saw firemen at a
house but no sign of a fire, and a few minutes later we saw an ambulance and
someone had obviously had an accident with a bonfire. Throwing fireworks on it
perhaps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was a happy evening till
just before we got home, then I ruined it. I suddenly felt terribly unhappy

says I must cease all kinds of work for probably up to a month. It seems likely
I shall be going to a Nursing Home, somewhere I can run, walk, climb and forget
everything. I don’t dislike the idea; I just feel I must get away from
everything and everyone so that I can collect my thoughts. Shall I see Helen
again, shall I see her less regularly, or just as we have been doing? If she
weren’t so afraid of all that it means, would she ever love me as I love her?</span></p>

lost count of what day it is and I have written today’s [Tuesday’s] notes on
yesterday’s [Monday] page. So these are Monday’s happenings [recorded on the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got up early and during the
morning I went to the Library and walked round the village with Ginger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner I walked for miles
taking Ginger with me. I wanted to get away from everything so that I could
start to think. I walked along </span><span lang=EN-GB>Shirley Road</span><span
 lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stratford</span><span lang=EN-GB> Road to
</span><span lang=EN-GB>Union Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> above the Odeon,
Shirley, down </span><span lang=EN-GB>Blossomfield Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>
and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Widney Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB>, and up </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Church Hill Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> into </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Solihull</span><span lang=EN-GB> village. Out in the country there
were fields of blackened corn which had not been harvested because of the
weather.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got in at </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and heard Graham [Gauld] announce “Music
from the Movies” in This Week’s Programmes” in <i>Children’s Hour</i>. He also
played part of <i>Genevieve</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>6.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> I called for Freda [at </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>1166 Warwick Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>] and we went to the
Futurist to see <i>Three Coins in the Fountain</i> in CinemaScope. This is the
8th week of its run. It was a pleasant film, shot in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Rome</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, its chief merits being its settings and colour. The three love
stories were rather trite and it seemed that the writer of the screenplay
realised this and had to put in a quite unnecessary complication at one point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            For me, the main point of
interest today was my “Music from the Movies” broadcast at </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.25pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The music was:–</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>1. <i>Lullaby of Broadway</i> sung by Doris
Day</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>2. “Busy Doing Nothing” from <i>A Yankee at
King Arthur’s Court</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>3. A snatch of the Zither Melody from <i>The
Third Man</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>4. Larry Adler’s theme music from <i>Genevieve</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>5. “Wunderbar” from <i>Kiss Me Kate</i>
sung by Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>6. Part of <i>An American in </i></span><i><span
  lang=EN-GB>Paris</span></i><span lang=EN-GB> by George Gershwin</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>7. “The Mounted Who Never Gets His Man”
from <i>Rose Marie</i> sung by Howard Keel</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>8. “Rose Marie I love you” from the same
film.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Graham did the programme
extremely well. I feel now I would rather that he broadcast any further
programmes of mine rather than do them myself. I was glad he included <i>Rose Marie</i>
– it brought the programme right up to date. The film hasn’t even been shown in
the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Midlands</span><span lang=EN-GB> yet and was only
released on October 11th. Mam said Dad always used to sing the last song to her
and [it] is one of her favourites.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I started “Music from the
Movies” on April 12th so the programme has taken just 190 days to go on the
air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was rather disappointed when
I woke up to find it was </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.20am</span><span
lang=EN-GB> as I had intended to walk to town. There was still time though, so
I set off at </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.45am</span><span lang=EN-GB>, did some
shopping at Lewis’s and was home again by </span><span lang=EN-GB>2.15pm</span><span
lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At 3.30 I went to the Post
Office and sent Dr. Schneider the laboratory key by registered post. Then I
cycled to the doctor’s where I had rather a long wait.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            During the evening I wrote an
air letter to Margaret [in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Canada</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Today was Local Preachers
Mutual Aid Association Sunday and our preachers were Mr. J. Pennington and Mr.
A. Tegla Davies, M.A.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The hymns this morning were 289
<i>Spirit divine, attend our prayers</i>, 25* <i>Psalm 23</i>, 845 <i>God make
my life a little light</i>, 695 <i>Praise, Lord, for Thee in </i></span><i><span
  lang=EN-GB>Zion</span></i><i><span lang=EN-GB> waits</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB>, and 811 <i>Thy kingdom come, O God</i>. The readings were Psalm 27
and John 3:1-17.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Pennington spoke on Romans </span><span lang=EN-GB>1:16</span><span lang=EN-GB>, “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of
Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.”
What was the world coming to? Was there no hope? Jesus Christ was our hope, but
the Church wasn’t standing up for itself, for what it believed. People were
turning their backs on Christ, then putting the blame on the Church. Mr.
Pennington’s portrait of the world today, of suspicion and hatred, confirmed my
own Pacifist convictions. Two World Wars have brought us no nearer to
international peace and goodwill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I took Dorothy Fitton’s Sunday School
class this afternoon (the story was of Zaccheus), then at </span><span lang=EN-GB>4.00pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> there was a Youth Team meeting. The next
service is at Ward End on November 14th. I shall not be taking part as I may be
away by that time. Last Sunday’s service was really the end of the beginning.
Now that the three principle speakers [Pat Welch, Jos Pardoe and I] are on the
Plan new speakers will be needed. Brian Sharpe and Michael Daw will probably be
two of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At tonight’s service we sang 11
<i>With gladness we worship, rejoice as we sing</i>, 28* <i>Psalm 30</i>, 477 <i>Son
of God, if Thy free grace</i>, 235 <i>I know that my Redeemer lives</i>, and
577 <i>O loving Lord, who art for ever seeking</i>. The readings were Genesis
18:20-33 and Romans 12. Mr. Tegla Davies’ sermon was on Proverbs 29:18, “Where
there is no vision, the people perish.”</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>MIDLAND PARADE. BRIAN BROADCASTS.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>One of the most persistent of our youthful
broadcasters must be 18-year old Brian D. Williams of Acocks Green, </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span lang=EN-GB>, whose “Music from the Movies”
was heard in the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Midland</span><span lang=EN-GB>
Children’s Hour last Tuesday. He has been broadcasting regularly since he was
13, when he gave a talk on Bird-watching.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            Talks, the reading of stories
and poetry, the selection of gramophone records to illustrate a theme, the
writing of scripts – all that sort of thing seems to have come easily to young
Mr. Williams.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            And all that despite the
claims made upon his time by his schooling at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span
lang=EN-GB>’s King Edward’s School and latterly his studies in the University’s
Department of Pharmacology, and his diary.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            Young Mr. Williams is hoping
to become a B.Sc.; he is already a trainee local preacher (one service a month)
and is looking forward to being placed on the permanent list; and he has just
started on the second half-million words of his diary.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            His diary – started seven
years ago – is not confined to a recording of happenings. “I use it to express
ideas that occur to me and views on people and events. I also use it for the
writing of reviews of films and plays I see. The task of expressing thoughts
and feelings in words I find very educative. </span><span lang=EN-GB

<p class=topic><span lang=EN-GB>Underwood typewriter</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Walking home with Helen last
night, when she said we couldn’t go for a walk on Wednesday, I lost my temper
and shouted at her quite unjustifiably. I was terribly sorry afterwards that I
had been so hurtful, and I felt so miserable with myself that I went for a walk
as far as the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Rialto</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Helen’s
’bus passed me and she looked rather unhappy, but I couldn’t help wondering
whether it was entirely my fault.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got up at 8.15 this morning,
went an errand to Mr. Evans’ s shop [formerly Jones and Evans, grocers], then
walked down to Busby’s, the second-hand shop on </span><span lang=EN-GB>Warwick
  Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>. On Saturday Mam and Dad saw an old typewriter
for sale at £3 5s. 0d. I said it wasn’t worth £3, offered 45/-d for it and got
it for 50/-d, and they delivered it about </span><span lang=EN-GB>midday</span><span
lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The machine is an American
Underwood, made in 1917. It didn’t appear to have been used for many years and
was quite dirty. The ribbon had no carbon left on it, but all the keys seemed
satisfactory, though the lettering isn’t in perfect alignment. I cleaned it up
and oiled one or two parts, and removed as much as possible to make it easier
to clean.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to the park just before
dinner. Afterwards I walked to town and back with Ginger, bought a typewriter
ribbon from Pope’s and typing paper (1/6d.) from Woolworth’s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Cleaned up and with a new
ribbon the typewriter is just what I’ve wanted for a long time. I had been
thinking of buying a portable. Strange … Dr. Gough says I am not to pick up pen
or pencil, and in less than a week I’ve got just the answer to my writing
problems. God <i>does</i> work in mysterious ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At 7.30 tonight I heard part 8
of <i>Journey Into Space</i>.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>This is the second series of </span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-style:normal'>Journey into Space</span><span lang=EN-GB>.
The present story is called “The Red Planet” and is set in 1971. The first
series, “A Tale of the Future”, set in 1965, began last year on Monday 21st
September and was very popular at school. The pilot of space-ship “Luna” Jet
Morgan is played by Andrew Faulds, Stephen “Mitch” Mitchell by Bruce Beeby
(replacing Don Sharpe in the first series), Lemmy Barnett by David Kossoff, and
Doc. Matthews by Guy Kingsley Poynter. The music is written and conducted by
Van Phillips, and the programme is written and produced by Charles Chilton
(whose Western adventure, </span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-style:normal'>Riders
of the Range</span><span lang=EN-GB>, finished its sixth and final series on
14th September last year) There is also a Pan paperback of Journey Into Space,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I typed a letter
to Mr. Plater. I hadn’t been able to complete a letter I wrote him on September
14th, and he wrote to me on August 23rd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Just before dinner I went down
the village for Mam; in the afternoon I walked down [</span><span lang=EN-GB>Woodcock
  Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB> and] </span><span lang=EN-GB>Clay Lane</span><span
 lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Coventry</span><span lang=EN-GB> Road,
along the 36 ’bus route to Tyseley and into Acocks Green along </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Warwick Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>. It rained heavily for the
last hour [0.435 inches] and Ginger and I were very wet when we got back at </span><span lang=EN-GB>4.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            During the evening I read my
library book by John Creasey called <i>Dead or Alive</i>. It’s a “Department 2”
thriller. I also listened to <i>Jennings at School</i> at </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got up at </span><span lang=EN-GB>five past eleven</span><span lang=EN-GB> this morning and until dinner I
typed part of my sermon for my first L.P. service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This afternoon I went for a
long walk with Ginger, the exact opposite to the walk I did ten days ago,
except that we walked right down </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stratford Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB> to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Reddings Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I
didn’t get home till </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. On
the way to Olton I had met Mrs. Walker and we spent half an hour talking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This evening I listened to a
play by Max Kester in <i>Curtain Up!</i> It was “The Business at Blanche Capel”
adapted from the novel by Bryan Morgan, with Sebastian Shaw and Cecile
Chevreau, Jean Taylor-Smith and Jack Allen. Blanche Capel is the intriguing
name of a Virus Research Station.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            On getting a haircut this
morning it came as something of a shock to find my hair has gone back half an
inch at the temples. My hair has been coming out in considerable quantities for
eighteen months or more. I feel tempted to ask whether Helen might love me
after all if I get a bit bald!!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner I walked to Hay
Mills with Ginger, went down </span><span lang=EN-GB>Kathleen Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB> for the first time since July 1941, and went to Granma’s [at </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>236 Millhouse Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>] for an hour. Grace was
there with baby Patrick whom I’d not seen before. Grandad is ill again, having
had an abscess on the lung.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I’ve heard <i>Town Forum</i>
from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Milan</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The team was Sir

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I walked to town
and took my note to the Almoner at G.H.B. It rather looks as though I shall be
going into the Victoria Nursing Home at Clevedon. The cost is met mainly by the
Public Health Department, and I had to go to their offices in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Congreve Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> to see the Assessment
Officer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            On Monday evening TV’s <i>The
Conductor Speaks</i> comes from the Town Hall with Rudolf Schwarz and the
C.B.S.O. I meant to write for a ticket but didn’t, so I called at the B.B.C. to
see if I could get one. As most of the offices are now at </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Carpenter Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> I walked to Edgbaston via </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Five Ways</span><span lang=EN-GB>. By the time I got there it was
lunch-time, so the Commissionaire (who said he was used to me now!) told me to
’phone in the afternoon and ask for Miss McDonald. I walked to </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Bristol Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> then caught the 1A ’bus home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I did ’phone the B.B.C. about </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> but, as I expected, all the tickets had
gone. After ’phoning I took Ginger for a walk down the village. Later I
stitched Ginger’s collar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I took Helen to the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Tivoli</span><span lang=EN-GB> to see <i>Roman Holiday</i>, one of
last year’s top films. It won a Seal of Merit in <i>Picturegoer</i>, and Audrey
Hepburn won the Actress of the Year award for her performance. It truly was an
excellent film, a romantic comedy in which a Princess on an official visit to </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Rome</span><span lang=EN-GB> falls in love with a newspaper
reporter (Gregory Peck). The film lasted two hours and the photography was
wonderful. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It’s </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>10.20pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. and I have just returned from
having a long chat with Mr. Dibben – over two hours. I’ve been so depressed
again I felt it would be best if I did not take part in tomorrow morning’s
service at Saltley – I didn’t feel I could give of my best. Mr. Dibben and I
talked about the different things that have been on my mind and convinced me
that if I continue to feel as strongly as I do now about pacifism, I am doing
the best thing in becoming a Conscientious Objector. Mr. Dibben also agreed with
me that anyone feeling as strongly as I do about this matter who still does
National Service is being a traitor to his own faith. Obviously Mr. and Mrs.
Walker and David aren’t Conscientious Objectors at all, despite what Mrs. Walker
says.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I asked Mr. Dibben about how
one becomes a Methodist minister. The training is a long one but one has to
become an Accredited Local Preacher first, so I can still continue with my
B.Sc. Mr. Dibben says that L.P. studies are not difficult, so I should be able
to keep up with them as well as B.Sc. classes, when I am fit and well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben also gave me some
advice about Helen and told me not to be quite so serious. I wish I wasn’t so
seriously-minded – I try not to be. He also said it was easy to think you had a
lot in common with someone you love, when in fact you hadn’t. Still, I’m
certain we do have much in common – Helen’s own serious thoughts of mind have
been astoundingly similar to mine, in a way I would never have dreamt. Time
will tell …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            In the afternoon Mick Daw
called for me and we went on the 44 ’bus to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Barn Lane</span><span
lang=EN-GB> for the Youth Club’s friendly match with Wellesbourne F.C. It was
to be my first game for years and years and I hadn’t worn my football boots
since </span><span lang=EN-GB>November 26th 1953</span><span lang=EN-GB>, and I
got quite sentimental scraping </span><span lang=EN-GB>Eastern Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB> mud from my boots when I got them re-studded in the morning. I
played inside-left today but not very well. We won 8-3 (half-time 2-1).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I went to the Library
and borrowed <i>Call the Toff</i> by John Creasey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Terry took this morning’s
service. We sang 681 <I>God of mercy, God of grace</I>, 6* <I>Jubilate Deo</I>, 850 <I>Looking
upward every day</I>, 519 <I>Thee, Jesus, full of truth and grace</I> and 270 <I>My heart is
full of Christ</I>. The readings were from Psalm 37 and 1 Corinthians 1-17.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben took tonight’s
service. The hymns were 7 O heavenly King, look down from above, 47* Psalm
91:1-6, 9-16, 477 Son of God, if Thy free grace, 38 Father of heaven, whose
love profound, and 624 Jesus, still lead on. The readings were Psalm 51 and
Romans 16.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After this evening’s service I
asked Helen if she would come out with me on Wednesday. I was almost certain
she would say no, she would be too busy. I don’t know whether she was being
absolutely truthful or just thoughtless. The silly child has got a lot to do
and doesn’t seem to know how to get things done and to make time. Because I
usually can, I suppose I expect too much. But I do think she could at least
have thanked me for asking her out. I hate being taken for granted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I watched Rudolf
Schwarz and the C.B.S.O. in <i>The Conductor Speaks</i> on Television. The
Orchestra played a chorus from Mendelssohn’s <i>Elijah</i>, a movement from the
<i>Concerto for Organ and Orchestra</i> by Handel, Waltzes from <i>Der
Rosenkavalier</i> by Richard Strauss and Choral Dances from <i>Prince Igor</i>
by Borodin. The programme was from the Town Hall. Rudolf Schwarz introduced

my letter to Mr. Plater but forgot to post it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            In the afternoon I went to the
Library – it rained all day [0.945 inches] until the evening and I couldn’t go
for a walk – and I found that Jeanette Hugh had given me a half-page write-up
in the <i>Birmingham Weekly Post</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had invited John round for </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.45pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and he arrived about </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. We talked, listened to the radio, and
played some of my gramophone records.</span></p>

village and bought a few Christmas cards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The rain worsened after dinner
[0.395 inches fell today], so I stayed indoors and watched TV for an hour, a
film drama <i>Night Train to Danger</i> followed by <i>Breeding Time</i> at the
Severn Wildfowl Trust with Peter Scott introducing the latest arrivals at
Slimbridge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to see John tonight. As

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The weather was fine this
morning so I took Ginger for a walk to town via </span><span lang=EN-GB>Coventry
  Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Deritend and Digbeth, and back home via Camp
Hill, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stratford Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> and </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight I have watched the
second half of the Arsenal v. Spartak match from Highbury [TV, </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.30-9.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>] which the Russian team won 2-1.
Spartak also brought on a substitute for a player who was not injured, and
there was disputation as to whether Arsenal should have been awarded a penalty
when one of their players was fouled. Wolves are due to play Spartak at
Molineux next Tuesday. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Just lately I haven’t slept
well, and after two or three restless nights I slept until </span><span lang=EN-GB>midday</span><span lang=EN-GB>, and even then Mam had to wake me. For the
first time since I’ve been home I didn’t go out during the day. Most of the
time it was raining [a further 0.66 inches].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner I watched the
second half of the </span><span lang=EN-GB>England</span><span lang=EN-GB> v. </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Wales</span><span lang=EN-GB> match from Wembley. Teams:–</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>England</span></b><span lang=EN-GB>:-
Wood; Staniforth, Byrne; Phillips, Wright, Slater; Matthews, Bentley, Allen,
Shackleton, Blunstone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Wales</span></b><span lang=EN-GB>:-
King; Williams, Sherwood (Capt.); Paul, Daniel, Sullivan; Tapmott, Ford,
Charles, Allchurch, Clark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was a most exciting match. At
half-time [when the transmission began] Wales were leading 1-nil with a goal by
the Leeds United centre-forward John Charles. Midway through the second half
Roy Bentley (</span><span lang=EN-GB>Chelsea</span><span lang=EN-GB>) equalised
with a header from a Stanley Matthews’ pass. Five minutes later Bentley headed in
a corner kick by Blunstone (also Chelsea) to give </span><span lang=EN-GB>England</span><span
lang=EN-GB> the lead. A minute later Charles made it 2-2, but just before the end
Roy Bentley scored the winner in a goalmouth scrimmage. [The match was played
in icy-cold drenching rain which kept the attendance down to 90,000 instead of
the usual 100,000 for an International match or Cup Final. The Spartak team sat
in the stand to watch the match.] </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I took Ginger for a walk to the
College Arms at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got up at 8.30 today. After
breakfast I went for a walk all round the village with Ginger. It was rather
windy and there was rain in the air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mam and I went to town to get
me a new raincoat this afternoon. I walked and got to the Co-op, High Street,
in forty-five minutes – I ran nearly all the way from the Mermaid Inn
[Sparkbrook, then down </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stratford Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB> to Camp Hill, Deritend, Digbeth and the Bull Ring]. I can get to
town now in forty minutes. We got my raincoat, a “Swallow” in slate-grey
gabardine (10 guineas!) then I walked home again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>8.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> Dad and I went to the second meeting
of the Men’s Fellowship. Mr. Harold T. Sharpe led a discussion on “Christianity

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had my breakfast in bed this
morning but didn’t get up late. I washed up then went down to the Post Office
to send a registered packet containing my [Kelton] watch and Grandad’s, to </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Dundee</span><span lang=EN-GB> for repair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Then I took Ginger for a walk
to the park. Heavy rains recently have swollen the streams, and in parts of the
park the grass is under water [2.645 inches of rain have fallen in the last 8
days].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I saw a smallish bird running
by the edge of the stream and I followed it for two hundred yards. It would
perch on a stone in mid-stream then, with a joyful “teet”, fly on, dipping
nearly to the water’s surface. This was the Grey Wagtail which is surely one of
our most delightful small birds – certainly my favourite. There were two birds.
I had not previously seen this species in Acocks Green, but today its very
exuberance lightened my heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner I went my usual </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Grange Road-Stratford Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> walk and got
home just after </span><span lang=EN-GB>4.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to the Club tonight for
the first time for months, and had to do the washing up! Helen came to Choir
Practice and afterwards we took Freda home [to </span><span lang=EN-GB>1166
  Warwick Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>], and continued our walk down </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Oxford Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dudley
  Park Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Westley Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hazelwood Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>.
Helen was much happier tonight. The P.T.S. has been getting her down and she
had a good cry again in the week, but she was much more cheerful again this
evening and we had a happy walk together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            One of my letters this (Friday)
morning was from G.H.B. I am going into the Victoria Convalescent Home,

breakfast wearing my new raincoat for the first time. I got back just after
ten, then called for Freda whom I had promised to take to the M.N.I. in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Clay Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I wanted to get my Sickness
Benefit but wasn’t able to get it except by waiting an hour or two. Freda had
an interview about her having to pay 24/-d for N.I. stamps when she was ill for
8 weeks. As she had only been at work five weeks she could not claim Sickness
Benefit, but now she does not have to pay the money if she produces a doctor’s
note for the eight weeks’ absence. We got out just after </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB> then we walked to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Coventry
  Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> and back home down </span><span lang=EN-GB>Yardley

<p class=topic><span lang=EN-GB>Overseas Missions</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I went with the
Youth Team to Ward End, Faye Dibben, Freda and I in Pat’s car, Ann Pardoe,
Rosemary and Michael [Daw] in Mr. Pardoe’s. This time the service was a replica
of the one we did at our own Church the other week, but Michael led, Freda did
the Children’s Address and read a lesson, and Pat and Ann spoke. After the service
Mr. Harvey conducted two Christenings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At tonight’s service, the
preacher was Rev. Chile O. Ogan from Eastern Nigeria whose talk on Overseas
Missions was summed up by Matthew 9:37: “The harvest truly is plenteous, but
the labourers are few.” In </span><span lang=EN-GB>Eastern Nigeria</span><span
lang=EN-GB> there were six Methodist Districts which it was hoped would form a
West African Conference in a few years, with its own </span><span lang=EN-GB>Theological</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>College</span><span lang=EN-GB> and
providing its own training. There were problems of Nationalism, Paganism,
Materialism, Catholicism, Communism. There was a need for aggressive evangelism,
African leadership and Methodist technicians and experts. They especially
needed hospitality in white countries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We sang hymn 426 <i>Ye servants
of God, your Master proclaim</i>, 58 <i>The Lord Jehovah reigns</i>, 801 <i>From
Greenland’s icy mountains</i>, 804 <i>Spread, O spread thou mighty word</i>”
and 795 <i>O Church of God, arise</i>. The lessons were Luke 14:15-24 and
Matthew 9:35-38.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After the service Helen and I
went for a walk, our last for a few weeks. We were very happy together but both
of us felt we were purposely being extra-happy, and knew we might be sad a
little later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We walked along </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Clay Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Yardley
  Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>, up </span><span lang=EN-GB>Westley Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hazelwood Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>.
I think Helen wanted me to spank her, since she asked me if I was going to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was up at 7.30 this morning
and out by </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.30am</span><span lang=EN-GB>. It was very
foggy, and the ’bus took almost an hour to get into town. I like travelling,
perhaps because one meets and sees so many people. On the ’bus I was sorry for
a blind woman, amused by our driver who opened his cab door to swear at another
motorist, and delighted when a pretty girl apologised for treading on my foot!
Of course, I might easily have put my foot there purposely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            In </span><span lang=EN-GB>New
  Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> I bought some <i>Scarlet Quill</i> stationery and
some ink, then rushed off to Snow Hill, a suitcase in each hand. I had had a
hard job packing and I had to sit on the suitcases to get them shut. I had
horrible visions of a suitcase flying open in the town and scattering pants,
vest, shirt and everything all over the street, but my fears were unfounded.
There was a small queue at the Booking Office and I thought I might miss the
train, but had ten minutes to spare. The fare to Clevedon was £1 10s 8d.
Obviously, not many people travel this way -- my ticket was a GWR one and the
fare marked at 21/9d.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The train was the Cornishman,
headed by No.5045 <i>Earl of </i></span><i><span lang=EN-GB>Dudley</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB> (surely I‘ve been pulled by this before?). We left at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.52am</span><span lang=EN-GB>, two minutes late, and at Acocks Green
Station we stopped for 15 minutes. In the thick fog the train was running
several minutes late, but after we had gone through </span><span lang=EN-GB>Stratford</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and the Cotswolds, the fog gave way to beautiful sunshine. I had
two companions on the train. One looked at least a Russian Spy. He had thick
greying hair which stood out from his head, a moustache, and an accent I could
not identify. He also kept talking to himself all the time. But he was quite a
nice fellow because he gave me some chocolate biscuits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>11.30am</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bristol</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, and as filthy a fog as I have ever seen. The connection train was
waiting on the other side of the platform. It was not a long journey to Yatton
where I [crossed the bridge and caught the12.38pm] third train to Clevedon [a
single coach pulled by a 14xx Class 0-4-2PT locomotive].This latter part of the
journey [a little over three miles] took less than 10 minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Outside the station [I turned
left, and was directed up </span><span lang=EN-GB>Chapel Hill</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Lower Linden Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and], it did not take me long to find </span><span lang=EN-GB>Princes
  Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> and the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Victoria</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Home</span><span lang=EN-GB> [almost at
the top on the far side]. The matron [Mrs. L. Allen] took me in and later I was
taken into the Conservatory and introduced. The Captain is Jock, a Scotsman. We
had a few sandwiches, then as tea wasn‘t till </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>4.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> I went out for a walk. From the
station I went along </span><span lang=EN-GB>Old Church Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, past the quarried Hangstone Hill, to the beach. Here I sat and
finished the letter to Helen I had been writing on the train, watched by a
friendly robin who brushed my hair twice. Down at the water‘s edge, there was a
number of screaming gulls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Clevedon gives me the
impression of being the sort of place where people come to die. It has a
population of about 8,000 [9,524 according to the 1951 Census], and is a well
spread out town built of local Pennant stone. The coastline is broken and
rugged, and the beach is stony. Above the town is tree-clad Dial Hill, 296 feet
high. Behind Clevedon lies the Gordano, an area of moor and hill from which
rise the Mendips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The House is very comfortable with
Matron’s office, dining room and lounge on the ground floor, and large bedrooms
(dormitories) on the two floors above. There are bookshelves in the lounge,
including the <i>Clevedon Official Guide 1951</i>, and a games room in the
basement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I slept well last night. At
seven we had a cup of tea in bed. There was a bell at </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.45am</span><span lang=EN-GB> when we came downstairs, and breakfast was

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After breakfast there was prayers
at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB> – a hymn, a reading

lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I stayed in after dinner, then
went for a walk again after tea. By now it was dark and across the water I
could see the lights of </span><span lang=EN-GB>South Wales</span><span

this afternoon so we stayed in till </span><span lang=EN-GB>3.0pm</span><span

having an interesting discussion on religion in the conservatory. I didn’t
start it, but I couldn’t resist carrying it on. About an hour before tea Jim,
Henry and I went a walk along the front and met Bob. We all sat on a bench

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>FRIDAY 19th NOVEMBER</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went off by myself this
morning [walking down to the pier and turning right, then past the Edgarley
Hotel and] along Lovers’ Walk to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ladye</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bay</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Nearby is a
church [St. Mary’s, Walton–in Gordano] which I visited on the way back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After diner thirteen of us went
by coach to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bristol</span><span lang=EN-GB> where we
were to tour W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills’ tobacco factory. On the way we saw the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Clifton</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Suspension
  Bridge</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At the factory we saw first how
the tobacco arrives in large bales. It is dampened, blended and shredded,
wrapped around in a long continuous tube of paper, and then fed into an
electronically-controlled machine which chops it into individual cigarettes,
each with a filter, at the rate of 2,500 per minute. A single packing machine handles
a million cigarettes every day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The cigarettes are then introduced
into the familiar packets and these are automatically conveyed into cartons,
each carton holding 6,000 packets, for delivery to the wholesaler and thence to
the customer. It was most fascinating to watch. We were each given a packet of
ten cigarettes as a souvenir of our visit. If only they still issued cigarette
cards!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I played snooker again tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a restless night last

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            There was a letter from her
this morning. My darling sweetheart <i>is</i> missing me and is rather sad but
she doesn’t know why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning Jim, Henry and I
walked along the front, [through Salthouse Woods and along Poet’s Walk past the
little church [St. Andrew’s] and up to a point on Wain’s Hill where we could
have looked miles down Channel and seen Flatholme and Steepholme had it not
been for a heavy mist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Jim [Allwood] is Captain now.
After breakfast we said Goodbye to Jock [who was Captain this week], Bill, Reg

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It’s </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>9.45pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and I’m sitting in bed. Outside a
gale is blowing and it was raining heavily not very long ago, but the weather
was fine until about </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.00pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning Henry, Jim and I
walked along the front before going to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Clevedon</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Methodist</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Church</span><span lang=EN-GB> which is just round the corner from
the Home [in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Lower Linden Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>].
The preacher was Rev. [space left] and the text was Romans 14:21, “It is good
neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother
stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak”, and then gave an excellent sermon
on the perils of drinking and smoking, as it is Temperance Sunday which has
been observed since about 1850. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The annual expenditure on beer
in this country is £869,000,000. If all the children who are in some way
suffering because of this social evil were lined up and moved at the rate of
one child per second it would take 12 days and nights to for the procession to
pass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Christian Citizenship Sunday
was started in about 1880. Drink is a narcotic, it numbs and stupefies; there
is a relationship between drink and crime, venereal disease. etc. Sir George
Newman was mentioned. The manufacture of beer utilises valuable grain and sugar
but is of little food value. The percentage of people employed in the industry
is small but the profits are enormous. The sale of beer results in depression,
but the drink industry has power with the press, the B.B.C. and advertising.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Drinking in moderation is no
answer – all such exhortations are vain. It was total abstinence or nothing,
because the temptation is too great for the weak-willed who cannot keep
moderate. Self-discipline is required for the Gospel’s sake, pleas for
moderation do not work. Is moderate drinking a mark of moral superiority? No,
it is a mark of moral indifference to the needs of others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was a gloomy day but I went

a 10/-d. note. The weather in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span

another very bad cold, and Mam has a stiff neck and shoulders, and painful
hands. She asks if I have put on any weight yet and do I feel more relaxed in
body and mind? Ginger is as lively as a cricket and Dinah too. On Friday a
young lady called, doing animal nutrition research, and asked if we have a dog?
Mam said we have two, and half an hour later a van drove up and gave Mam 21
tins of dog meat, 2 tins a day for Ginger and one a day for Dinah, so a week’s
supply. They are usually 9d each, so that was 15/9d worth! In return Mam has to
fill in a form every day for a week to report whether the dogs like the food,
which apparently they do! Mam had a mishap with the boiler on Tuesday and
flooded the kitchen floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning four of us walked

  lang=EN-GB>Castle</span><span lang=EN-GB> and I took a couple of photographs,
one of Jim [jpg] and another of Reg and Jack. Later I saw the doctor and was
advised to stay for a third week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This evening Jack, Jim and I
walked to Seeleys and along the sea-front and then to the Maxime Cinema in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Old Church Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>. It is an impressive
building running parallel with the main road, the entrance at the right-hand
end and a café running full-length above it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:16.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<div style='border:none;border-right:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0cm 12.0pt 0cm 0cm'>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>At the time of my stay in Clevedon I was
unaware of the significance of the Maxime as the longest continuously operating
cinema in the country. The Picture House (as it was called) was opened on </span><span lang=EN-GB>Saturday 20th April 1912</span><span lang=EN-GB>, a few days after the
sinking of the Titanic. People flocked to the first performance and the
proceeds were sent to the Lord Mayor of </span><span lang=EN-GB>London</span><span
lang=EN-GB>’s Relief Fund to help survivors of the disaster and those bereaved.
Despite two World Wars the cinema had remained open (at the time of my visit)
for 42½ years and (in 2007) has never failed to open in 95 years, making it
unique in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Europe</span><span lang=EN-GB> and probably the
world.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            The Picture House was built by
Victor E.J. Cox, son of John Newton Cox the local stonemason. Born at </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>West End</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Clevedon, in 1887, Victor was educated
at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Clevedon</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>College</span><span lang=EN-GB>. He developed a talent for
sculpture and stonemasonry and joined his father in the family business. But he
was also fascinated by the moving pictures and by 1910 had begun showing films
in Clevedon Public Hall (</span><span lang=EN-GB>Albert Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB>), and in the open-air at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Herbert</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Gardens</span><span lang=EN-GB> and the sea-front
bandstand, before investing his money in building The Picture House on land at
his father’s yard.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            The original building occupied
the western end of the present site in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Old Church Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB> (i.e. the right hand end facing the bottom of </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Hillside Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>) and is said to have seated
200 people. The projector was gas-illuminated. By the middle of 1913, without
interruption to the daily programme, The Picture House had been extended to
accommodate 389. A sliding roof was installed for ventilation, and electricity
– the first in Clevedon – to increase the brilliance of the pictures. In 1916
motorised projectors were installed.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            In 1919 Victor was able to
acquire the site at the eastern end of the building and The Picture House was
further extended and rebuilt between Saturday 6th March 1920 and Monday 12th
June 1922, not a show being missed. A dressing room (stage left), fly gallery,
boxes (one with an organ) and balcony were added, and the walls and ceiling
were lined with prefabricated moulded tin plate panels giving the illusion of
ornate Art Deco plasterwork. These greatly enhanced the quality of sound.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            A musical background to the
silent films was provided by a piano often played by Victor, and on a special
occasion his step-mother Blanche Howard – a professional singer who had toured </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Europe</span><span lang=EN-GB> – would entertain the audience.
Upstairs was the Oak Room café with direct access both from the auditorium and
the street. There were box offices on either end of The Picture House, the one
on the north-west corner for the more expensive seats. Above this corner, the
large semi-circular stained glass window to the café foyer was shattered by a
bomb which fell [date] at the bottom of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hillside Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. A gas main exploded, the blast pitted the stonework at this corner
of The Picture House, and a soldier standing at the entrance was killed –
Clevedon’s only casualty of the War.</span><b><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:16.0pt'> </span></b></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            In 1927 a sound-on-disc system
was introduced to provide sound for short films, and in 1930 two Zeis Ikon
projectors were installed, with Zeis arc-lamps and Western Electric Sound
utilising sound-on-film for the screening of feature films. The organ was
removed in 1929.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            On </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Monday 11th June 1945</span><span lang=EN-GB> Victor Cox sold The Picture
House to Maxwell Corn. On Sunday </span><span lang=EN-GB>5th August 1946</span><span
lang=EN-GB> it was renamed the Maxime, the name it still bore at the time of my
visit in 1954. In August 1953 it was sold to the Cleve Cinema company of </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Cardiff</span><span lang=EN-GB> and – some time after 1954 – was
renamed the Curzon. </span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            From about 1965 the cinema was
run for 30 years by Kenneth Eagles (projectionist) and his wife Janet (manager).
The cinema went into receivership in 1995 but a local resident Jon Webber
launched a “Save the Curzon” campaign, and it became The Curzon-Clevedon
Community Centre for the Arts with plans to restore it to its 1920’s grandeur.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            Victor Cox’s stepmother
Blanche lived [dates] to almost 100. Victor died in hospital at </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Bristol</span><span lang=EN-GB> on or about </span><span lang=EN-GB>Saturday 3rd June 1978</span><span lang=EN-GB>, aged 90.</span></p>

After breakfast Matron asked Jim and me to put Fred on the </span><span

had been for a walk round the town and along the front in the brilliant morning
sunshine, we came back to the Home and with Fred went down to the station,
calling at “The Bristol” on the way for a last drink together. We left Clevedon
at </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB> [the little train
arrived at Yatton at 11.07], and we put Fred on the 11.28 Paddington train
after a twenty minute wait at Yatton. Then we jumped back onto our Clevedon
train just as it was leaving [at 11.31, arriving at Clevedon 7 minutes later],
and were back in time for a good walk before dinner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner the weather was
again wet and windy and I didn’t go out again. I spent an hour reading my book

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>The Yatton train was, I believe, hauled by
14XX Class 0-4-2PT locomotive 1430 or 1463. Four locomotives of this class have
survived – 1420 (</span><span lang=EN-GB>South Devon</span><span lang=EN-GB>

two of them, 1401 and 1450, may be seen in action in the 1953 film The Titfield
Thunderbolt.</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            In this winter of 1954-55
there were no less than 29 “down” trains from Yatton to Clevedon, all of them
auto-worked except for the 2.00pm which was a diesel railcar (ex- Bristol Temple
Meads 1.5pm); and 30 “up” trains from Clevedon to Yatton, all auto-worked
except the 2.17pm which was the diesel railcar making the return journey to
Bristol via Yatton and the Cheddar Valley and North Somerset lines. (Actually, the
railcar alone was often too small for the number of passengers, so was run as a
twin-unit. However, this meant leaving the trailer behind at Yatton in order to
avoid the railcar having to run round it at Clevedon, so a 45XX, 57XX or 82XX
Class tank locomotive and coaches might be used instead.) There were two extra
trains on Saturdays and, from </span><span lang=EN-GB>1st May 1955</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, fourteen trains on Sundays (no Sunday working before that date). </span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            Incomprehensible as it would
have seemed in December 1954, in less than 9 years Clevedon Station would be
closed and the branch line cease to exist. The line was closed to goods traffic
on Monday 10th June 1963. The last passenger train – a two-car diesel multiple unit
-- left Yatton for Clevedon on </span><span lang=EN-GB>Sunday 6th October 1963</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. Clevedon became an unstaffed halt on Monday 20th April 1964 and,
following an abortive attempt to preserve the line, the station buildings were
razed to the ground in May 1968. Except for street names, all traces of the
railway have been obliterated.</span></p>

  lang=EN-GB>Methodist</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Church</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was a beautiful morning and
after breakfast Jim and I walked past the pool and along Poet’s Walk before
going to Church. Reg felt ill and so did not come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Rev. P.G. Lewis conducted the
service. It was immensely enjoyable. We sang 10 <i>Now thank we all our God</i>,
427 <i>Through all the changing scenes of life</i>, 842 <i>Gentle Jesus, meek
and mild</i>, 884 <i>Before Thy throne, O God, we kneel</i> (to the tune of 755
<i>Lord, Jesus Christ, our Lord most dear</i>) and 590 <i>Forth in Thy name, O
Lord, I go.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            His sermon was on Matthew 25:24-25,“Then
he which had received the one talent came and said … I was afraid”. There were
three facts which we should note.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>i. God’s gift of responsibility</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>. He leaves affairs largely in our hands. We have great
potentialities of responsibility and service because we are free.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>ii. Man’s rejection of responsibility</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>. Men were afraid they might lose their “one talent” so they buried
it – “ I want to live my own life”. But we are only trustees not proprietors of
our own lives. At </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.30am</span><span lang=EN-GB> on
Sunday there were as many British “Christians” listening to the B.B.C.’s <i>Morning
Service</i> as there were in all the churches put together. This was typical
mediocre complacency. There were some people who felt they were being called to
the Ministry but ignored the challenge and imagined they could serve God just
as well in Scientific Research. But we have a responsibility to man as well as
to God. The rejection of responsibility was a sin. With a Welfare State the
general attitude seemed to be “It’s not my job” and everyone left it to the
other man, and talked about the impossibility of being a Christian in a
non-Christian community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>iii. The reward of responsibility and
penalty of irresponsibility</span></b><span lang=EN-GB>. “I will set thee over
many things.” God makes a reckoning with us each day. If we let our capacities
dwindle we become incapable of bearing responsibility and God has no place for
us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Lewis also gave an
extremely good address to the children, and talked about a tempestuous
sea-crossing from the Channel Isles and a frail old lady of 84 who was making
only her third trip but wasn’t afraid. “I know the pilot” she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight’s preacher was the
Clevedon minister, Rev. J. Eddie Swales, and again there was an extremely good
service and a large congregation. The hymns were 679 <i>Pleasant are Thy courts
above</i>, 235 <i>I know that my Redeemer lives</i>, 780 <i>Master, speak! Thy
servant heareth</i>, 665 <i>Sweet is the work, my God, my King</i>, 688 <i>O
God our Father, who dost make us one</i>. The sermon was on Acts 10:33 – “Now
therefore are we here all present before God, to hear all things that are
commanded thee of God.” We must be there always. Every day, not just Sundays.
Thomas was missing when the Lord came … There were magnetic congregations as
well as magnetic preachers. Mr. Swales reminded us of Spurgeon’s aphorism that
“you can’t kindle a fire if there are ice-bergs in the pew”. All must help
together and pray.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Jim Allwood didn’t come tonight
as he wanted to go to “The Reading” for a last drink, but Jack and Reg came.
Jack nearly split his sides with laughing when Mr. Swales talked about people
writing notes on preachers’ services as I was busy scribbling away as usual.
Jack said Mr. Swales was looking at me the whole time. It certainly caused some
amusement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Nothing much else happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div style='border:none;border-right:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0cm 12.0pt 0cm 0cm'>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>The Reverend J. Eddie Swales entered the
ministry in 1918 and died in 1961. I should be grateful to receive further
information about him, and indeed about any of the ministers and clergy
mentioned in the Diary. “Rev P.G. Lewis”, who took the morning service, may
have been The Reverend Greville P. Lewis, M.A., B.D, Connexional Secretary of
the Local Preachers’ Department, whose books An Approach to the New Testament
and An Approach to Christian Doctrine Local Preachers on Trial were expected to
study.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a lovely letter from
Helen this morning, written on Friday but postmarked </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> yesterday. She says she is really missing
me, and to crown it all she has no half-day this Sunday. She thinks I am
earning the men’s respect by going to the pub with them even though I don’t
drink alcohol, and says she also doesn’t always kneel to say her prayers. Her
parents are both unwell, David (home on leave) is a bit fed up, and it is a
wonder she is not in sick bay. She wishes I was back and that we could have an
evening together, and feels like lying down to die (but not really), and asks
me to write soon, which I did straight away. She sends me all her love and two
kisses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a letter from Mam this
morning, only short as she has cut her thumb and the bandage was getting in the
way. She wants me to write to Dr. Gough and Mr. Balance and invite them for tea
on Sunday week, but that is very short notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After Prayers I took the box
round and then went to the newsagents to order the papers for this week. It is
the same as last week except for an extra <i>Daily Mirror</i> and one less <i>Daily
Mail</i>. All the papers today are celebrating the Prime Minister Sir Winston
Churchill’s 80th birthday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I played snooker again tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went bird-watching this
morning. [I walked down </span><span lang=EN-GB>Albert Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Victoria Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>
to the beach, and along past the bandstand.] At the pool there were 198
Oyster-catchers, 157 Black-headed gulls, 3 Herring gulls and on the way to </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>West Clevedon</span><span lang=EN-GB> many smaller birds, while
nearer home, there were another 120 gulls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            On the way home I bought this
week’s <i>John Bull</i>.</span><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>      </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This afternoon I went for a
walk with Jack, down Chapel Hill to the Clock Tower by the Station in the
Triangle, then from East Clevedon to the lovely Swiss Valley, about 4 miles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            </span><span lang=EN-GB>England</span><span

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>THURSDAY 2nd DECEMBER</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Yesterday there were two people
missing from prayers. One was Fred Leigh who said he didn’t intend coming into
prayers if he didn’t want to, and the Home was like a Concentration Camp! A
pig-headed view because there are few restrictions here, and there is no one
who cannot spare 5 minutes a day, four days a week. This morning though, he did
attend, and Harry also came in. We sang that lovely hymn, <i>I heard the voice
of Jesus say</i> (257, M.H.B.154).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After prayers Charles and Harry
sang some songs. When Jim and I went out it was raining. We went through the
town to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>West End</span><span lang=EN-GB> and back
along the front. I bought <i>Illustrated</i> which contained an 8-page
[unfinished]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a letter from Mam this
morning and wrote back during the day. Mam enclosed a cutting with two readers’
letters from the <i>Birmingham Mail</i> about the B.B.C.’s mispronunciation of
the English language.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After tea I played snooker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>FRIDAY 3rd DECEMBER</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Today I did one of the silly
little things I’ve always wanted to – swim in the sea in December. It was a
lovely day and I was determined at least to put my foot in. When Jim and I went
out I took my swimming trunks and we went to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ladye</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bay</span><span lang=EN-GB> along Lovers
Walk. It was an enjoyable dip but the rocks hurt my feet and I had to be wary
of the high waves knocking me against the rocks. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Ladye</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bay</span><span lang=EN-GB> isn’t the best
place for a swim, and beyond the Point the currents are dangerous. High tide
was at </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.10am</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We walked back along the front
as far as the Gift Shop where I got Jack 6/-d worth of rock, and home via </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>St. John’s Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt'>            After
dinner I wrote a letter to Helen and went out for an hour along the front. I
bought two tins of toffees for Clarice and Julia. After tea I finished my
letter and walked down to the beach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight after supper I asked
Chris if he would take over as Captain next week and he has agreed to do so.
It’s now </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>SATURDAY 4th DECEMBER</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a letter from Helen this
morning. She can tell I am much better, she says! Have I found the mermaid I
was looking for, and whatever was that girl doing in the middle of the road
with her shoes off? She hopes she is never caught doing something as silly as
that. Several times yesterday she was wishing I was there with her; it was her
day off (not Tuesday as I had thought). If my parents won’t mind she would like
to see me in town on Monday evening if possible, but will let me know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            She is glad I am Captain this
week: I am to enjoy the little responsibility. She feels really sorry for my
getting up early but perhaps the rough treatment I get from the others will do
me good – she is getting rather afraid, and I am not to be surprised if she
doesn’t turn up on Monday night! Like me she rarely sleeps with a pillow
beneath her head. At the hospital she has two -- she uses one as a cushion in
her wicker chair and the other as a barricade to push her head into. She hopes
it will please me that for about a week she has read her Bible every night. It
would not have done Jack any good to have died, or would it? She hopes I
wouldn’t die like that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This coming Monday she has to
attend a lecture which means going back tomorrow night and wasting the morning but
is still hoping for the best. She gives me a riddle to work out but then
remembers that it can only be told. She also has something to tell me about one
of the P.T.S. nurses who really is a scream. She must finish. She is looking
forward to when she can see me again, but it must not be any later than Monday
night, and she sends me all her love and two kisses. In a P.S. she hopes my
mother and Clarice are better. Her mother is fair, she (Helen) appears to be
alright but is sure she is thoroughly run-down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>        </span></b></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>SUNDAY 5th DECEMBER</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This is my last day here at
Clevedon. As usual I went to both services. Rev. J.E. Swales preached at the </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB> service. We sang 659 <i>O day of rest and
gladness</i> (to the tune of 701 <i>The Church’s one foundation</i>), 74 <i>Praise
to the Holiest in the Height</i>, 841 <i>Jesus, Friend of little children</i>,
479 <i>Fainting soul, be bold, be strong</i> (sung to the tune “Hollingside”
for 110), <i>Jesu, Lover of my soul</i>), and the closing hymn 451 <i>I lift my
heart to Thee</i>. The readings were Isaiah 5:1-16 and Luke 4:16-30.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Swales took as his text
Matthew 11:28-30, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy,
and my burden is light.” This passage expresses our need, for we all need rest
of body, contentment, satisfaction and peace of mind. Many are going the wrong
way to find it and so have a disappointing life. They have a house, a car, food
etc., but do they have peace? They achieve their ambition but are discontented.
It is perfectly Christian to seek a new social order and the betterment of
conditions, but the unrest in the world today is because of people’s empty
existence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>i. The rest that is given.</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> Jesus gives us peace of mind. There is the outer world and the
inner world of our mind. “Bring it to me,” He says. Bring Him our anger and
resentment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>ii. The burden borne.</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> The oxen, ass and camel are beasts of burden, they bear the yoke on
their shoulders (whereas the horse is for war). “My yoke is easy and My burden
is light,” He says, because we are yoked with Him. When a man marries he
doesn’t mind the yoke, it is joy to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>iii. We are yoked to Christ.</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> In Christian service we find ease, rest and contentment. He lifts
the burden of fear, anxiety, anger and secret sin. One million people take
sleeping tablets each night. Why? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. J. H. Laytham preached at tonight’s
service at </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. We sang 41 <i>God
is a name my soul adores</i>, 139 <i>The race that long in darkness pined</i>,
135 <i>Stupendous height of heavenly love</i>, 142 <i>Let earth and heaven
combine</i>, and 259 <i>And art Thou come with us to dwell</i>. The readings
were Psalm 119:97-112 and 2 Corinthians 3:1-11.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Laytham’s text was Isaiah
7:14, “Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall
conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” Jesus came into a
world dark with sin. It was an expression of God’s sorrow for the people,
reminding us of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Milton</span><span lang=EN-GB>’s <i>Paradise
Lost</i>. Our reaction should be:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>i. To realise God’s love for us</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> – stupendous love, as Charles Wesley tells us in Hymn 142 – and
respond to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>ii. To accept Christ’s birth as a
mystery.</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> We might find this difficult but there are
many mysteries in life, for instance the mystery of suffering and of sudden
death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>iii. To manifest Christ in our own
lives.</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> Mr. Laytham referred to Elizabeth Gouge’s <i>The
Well of the Star</i>.</span></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>MONDAY 6th DECEMBER</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Home again! I was sorry to
leave Clevedon after three happy weeks there. I got up before </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB> as I was rather concerned as to how I was
going to get underwear, pyjamas, shaving kit, several books, a towel, four
sticks of rock, writing case, ink, camera and binoculars into the small case.
But I managed to get everything packed before breakfast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After breakfast I said Goodbye
to Arthur and Harry, Jim Mulhall, Charles, Dick, Percy, Sid, Tom, Jim Tucker
and Oscar. Bob left while we were still having breakfast. The ambulance had to
get him to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bristol</span><span lang=EN-GB> by </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Matron told me to get a
Doctor’s note and come again next May or June. So with a suitcase in each hand
and my binoculars swung round my neck I left </span><span lang=EN-GB>Victoria</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Home</span><span lang=EN-GB> and caught
the 9.10 train [for Yatton, arriving at 9.17]. The </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bristol</span><span
lang=EN-GB> train was just coming in as I stepped down again at Yatton. At </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Temple</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Meads</span><span
lang=EN-GB> I had to cross to Platform 12 for the </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>10.20am</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Newcastle</span><span
lang=EN-GB> train. [A space left here for details of the journey to Snow Hill, </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span lang=EN-GB>, and my arrival home.].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got to town at 8.50 but it
was 9.10 before we saw each other. Helen was standing at the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Hill Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> corner. I was at the corner near
the fountain. We were forty or fifty yards apart when Helen saw me. She turned
and walked slowly towards me, and wanted to run to me, and I wanted to run to
her, but we kept on walking so self-consciously, and it seemed that an age
passed between when we saw each other and when I threw an arm round her. So
silly. There didn’t seem to be anything to say for the first few minutes
together again. We looked at the lighted Christmas tree with the children’s
notes to Santa Claus, and we gazed at the water in the fountain, then we saw
the coloured fountain in the Civic Centre, and walked along </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Broad Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> and looked in shop windows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I typed my script
and went to the Post Office to post it this afternoon at </span><span lang=EN-GB>4.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> after spending over an hour hunting for a
large envelope. It snowed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            On the way back I called to see
Helen. The doctor had not then called, so Mrs. Walker asked me to stay to tea.
Helen’s toe was very badly swollen and obviously painful, but she looked so
beautiful sitting curled up in an armchair with a shawl round her shoulders.
She set my heart on fire again!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The doctor called at </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> but by then the blister had burst. Helen
insisted on going back when a day in bed seemed called for. She is certainly
run down and cried when her mother and I tried to persuade her to go back at </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Right now, Helen is finding that the
world isn’t always very kind, and that people just don’t live up to the
standards we would like them to, and so she is bewildered and frustrated. One
always is as one finds one’s dream-world crumbling. I have been trying to warn
Helen of this, rather clumsily at times, for months now. In six months time she
will probably realise I was telling her the truth. In the meantime she should
realise that a Christian has to be a realist even if he is an idealist at
heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I think Helen is probably most
upset by the fact that a good many of the nurses at </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dudley
  Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> swear or smoke or tell smutty jokes and don’t
give Christianity a second thought, but she will take many of these things for
granted in time, as I learned to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I wish Helen would take a rest.
She is making exactly the same mistake I made in thinking it was rather clever,
and brave, and noble, to carry on when one’s common-sense says “Stop”. She is
overtired and facing a crisis, and like me, things are getting on her mind. I
wish she would see sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We persuaded Helen to go back
at </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>, so I left her to have
a good cry and called for her an hour later, by which time she was looking
happier. I took her to the bus and gave her some chocolates. She was limping badly,
I could hardly walk because of back-ache, so we made a fine pair!</span></p>

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>            As I have to make a return to
the Ministry of Health, on whose Certificate of Identification Brian Williams
has received deferment from National Service, I should be grateful if you could
let me have a note about him. In particular, I should be glad to know what you
think about his present condition and what progress he is making. It would also
be helpful to have some indication with regard to prognosis. His work was very
poor indeed just before he went sick, but this, of course, may well have been a
temporary trouble, due to his illness. Part of the agreement with regard to
deferment involves the periodic report on work in progress. The report for the
last quarter is now due, so that I should appreciate any help that you can give
me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I spent an hour
stitching my gloves then took Ginger for a walk via [Warwick Road], Kineton
Green Road and Streetsbrook Road [and back home via Fox Hollies Road and Olton
Boulevard East].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner I wrote a letter
to Helen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Nothing happened this morning
except that I saw Mrs. Walker and said I would go to visit Helen this evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            In the afternoon Ginger and I
went a walk [via </span><span lang=EN-GB>Olton Boulevard East</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Shaftmoor Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB> and
</span><span lang=EN-GB>York Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>, and then] along </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Stratford Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> from </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Reddings Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB> to Fox Hollies Road. I
bought Helen some Kit-Kat chocolate and a Fry’s Chocolate Cream. I nearly had
to buy a new cat for the sweet shop as Ginger nearly put the old one to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Before going to DRH [</span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Dudley</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Road</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB>] I went
to Walkers’ to collect some knitting. I got to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dudley

lang=EN-GB> and stayed until </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.0pm</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. Helen looked very pretty tucked up in bed. Cuckoo and another
friend also came to see her while I was there. I think Helen will be in bed
quite a time yet though her foot is getting better. It will keep [her] out of
mischief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I went to see Dr.
Gough and he signed me off, so I can go back to GHB [the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>General</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span lang=EN-GB>] on
Monday. It was a lovely morning so I walked down the village with Ginger. As I
came past the Church Mr. Dibben was just driving away after marrying Barbara
Allen and Ivan Evans. I seemed to meet everyone I knew while I was out, Freda
included. She said I looked “exactly the same” – trust somebody to spoil it!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I came home via </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Westley Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Olton
  Boulevard East</span><span lang=EN-GB>. It was still only </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.30am</span><span lang=EN-GB> so I went out again, this time to the
station. I have decided in future to travel to work by rail. The fare to Snow
Hill [and back] is 11d, the same as the return fare [5½ d each way] on the
’bus, and if I travelled to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Moor Street</span><span
lang=EN-GB> [9d return] I could save at least 2/-d a week. There are some very
good trains, the </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.36am</span><span lang=EN-GB> to Snow
Hill (8.49), the </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.40am</span><span lang=EN-GB> to </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Moor Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> (8.50), or the </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.45am</span><span lang=EN-GB> which goes straight through to Snow Hill
in 9 minutes. The </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.51am</span><span lang=EN-GB> gets
in at 9.5. Alternatively there is the </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.44 am</span><span
lang=EN-GB> from Spring Road to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Moor Street</span><span
lang=EN-GB> (8.54)</span></p>

<p class=date><span lang=EN-GB>SUNDAY 12th DECEMBER</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Everyone gave me a great
welcome back at Church this morning. Mr. Dibben took the [Boys Brigade Parade] service.
We sang 242 <i>Come, Thou long-expected Jesus</i>, 1* <i>Venite, exultemus
Domino</i>, 860 <i>Away in a manger, no crib for a bed</i>, 257 <i>O come, O
come Immanuel</i> and 595 <i>God of almighty love</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben preached on Matthew </span><span lang=EN-GB>10:16</span><span lang=EN-GB>, “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the
midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>1. In Bible days sheep were generally
despised as foolish. “All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every
one to his own way” (Isaiah 53:6). This demonstrates our inadequacy – we are <i>lost</i>
sheep. Jesus told of one sheep that fell into a pit on the Sabbath day and had
to be lifted out! (Matthew 12:11). Sheep are poor, feckless, foolish creatures,
and many times in the Psalms, God’s people are referred to as sheep. But, Jesus
says, His disciples are to be wise as serpents – “the serpent was more subtle
than any beast of the field” – but harmless as doves. The word “harmless” is
given in the margin as “simple”, it means “Unalloyed, of pure breed, single-minded.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Jesus was very subtle, as we
see from His reply to the tribute money question (Matthew </span><span lang=EN-GB>22:15</span><span lang=EN-GB>-22). He was also asked, “Who is my
neighbour?” – the one they despised, of course – but He gave a subtle answer.
One time, John Wesley was obstructed by a man on the pavement. The man said, “I
never get out of the way of fools.” John Wesley, said, “I do.” Nash said, “Your
preaching frightens people”, a common report.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>2. This subtlety which Jesus spoke of is
for one purpose. “Do all things to the glory of God” (1 Corinthians </span><span lang=EN-GB>10:31</span><span lang=EN-GB>). Our one-minded purpose is simplicity.
Jesus says, “<i>I</i> send you forth” – it is He who has called us, and He
says, “Be not anxious.” He is ever at hand to help us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. F.J. Green [our Local
Preachers’ secretary]was the preacher this evening. We sang 142 <i>Let earth
and heaven combine</i>, 34* <i>Psalm 48</i>, 426 Ye servants of God, your
Master proclaim, 92 <i>Jesus! The name high over all</i> and 8 <i>O worship the
King, all glorious above</i>. The readings were Psalm 34 and John 4:1-26, and
Mr. Green preached on John 4:24, “God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him
must worship Him in spirit and in truth.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>1. Why come to Church?</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> Why don’t more people come? Why do we come at all? There are many
criticisms of the Church: (a) The services are dull. So we must be vital,
vibrant. (b) Religion is irrelevant in life today. (c) Church membership is
held far too lightly – anyone can be a member, whereas people require a sponsor
or have to pay subscriptions for membership of clubs. (d) Doctrine is too
difficult. (e) The Church is divided in itself. (f) The fear of hypocrisy. (g)
The reaction of being forced to attend Sunday School etc. We are on show, we
are representative of Christians.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>2. Worship</span></b><span lang=EN-GB>.
(1) Have we come to Church tonight to adore God? (2) in thanksgiving, for life,
for every joy? (3) in confession? (4) to petition Him? (5) in intercession? (6)
did we say, “I will find rest, peace, quietude”?, which is the same as
meditation. (7) in rededication to His service/ Are we someone who is strong,
serene, loving ? (8) in forgiveness. The emphasis should not be on sin, our
inhibitions, complexes, perversions, hereditary rubbish. We have come for fellowship,
we are amongst our best friends. Are we short of a friend? Some people think
that fellowship can only be found in the pub. God gives power for us to live,
and we find God as we learn to worship Him in spirit and in truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At Y.P.F. we had a Bible
Scavenger Hunt devised by Pat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to work today for the
first time since October 15th. In some ways it seems a long time ago, but that
terrible despair and frustration came back to my mind as though it was only
yesterday that I last was there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I found plenty of jobs to do,
including the cleaning of the animals. Pam has been working in the lab during
my absence, and during the afternoon she showed me how to do a Warburg
experiment. Pam is leaving at Christmas to have her baby.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I took tea to work with me as I
was visiting Helen at DRH after work. It was raining heavily [0.26 inches fell
today] when I left work. I got to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dudley</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span lang=EN-GB> at </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>6.30pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and stayed nearly half an hour.
Helen is very sad, especially as there are now only two patients left in B.10.
Poor sweetheart! Obviously she will be in bed two or three days yet. I asked Helen
whether she would go to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Margate</span><span lang=EN-GB>
with us in 1955. I don’t expect she will, especially as her parents are
thinking of having a holiday themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Today I went to work on the
train for the first time. I didn’t do so yesterday as I was going to DRH in the
evening. I caught the </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.45am</span><span lang=EN-GB>
(dead on time) – Snow Hill 8.54. It went from Platform 4 instead of 2. I was at
work for </span><span lang=EN-GB>9.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB>. During the day
I phoned DRH [</span><span lang=EN-GB>Dudley</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Hospital</span><span

lang=EN-GB> as I had promised to do when I went to the Walkers last night.
Helen is still in bed and her parents went to see her tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Not much happened at work. I
came home on the </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.10pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> train
(it used to be the 5.05). This arrived at 5.28 so I was home very conveniently
early.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I.M.L.T. again this morning. I
forgot what time the class started and I arrived [at the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Medical</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>School</span><span
lang=EN-GB>] half an hour too soon. The class started early, and I came home to
dinner at </span><span lang=EN-GB>12.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. John Winrow
accompanied me to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Bristol Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I decided to go back to work on
the </span><span lang=EN-GB>1.55 Moor Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> train from
Spring Road. It got held up at two points so it was a bit late – </span><span lang=EN-GB>2.12pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Sometimes one’s travelling companions are
most interesting and amusing. There was one topic of conversation in my
compartment – fungi!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At work I started a Warburg
experiment but ruined it. I came back on the 5.45 from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Moor
  Street</span><span lang=EN-GB> – Spring Road </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>5.57pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            John came at 7.45 for an
evening of records.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            A busy day today. I caught the
8.45 train which was five minutes late. I had arrived just in time to catch the
</span><span lang=EN-GB>8.51am</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Bob Pardoe was in the
same compartment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had to wait 15 minutes for
Hilary to arrive. I ’phoned </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dudley Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and was told Helen would be discharged tomorrow. I also ’phoned
Mrs. Walker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I spent the morning washing up and doing
odd jobs. The sink looked as though it had not been washed down for the ten
weeks since I last did it. I also found eleven empty milk-bottles. Perhaps we
could buy a cow and start a dairy or something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner I bought some
Christmas cards from Woolworth’s. When I got back I smoked a trace for Alan and
later I helped him move his apparatus from one side of the bench to the other
so as to leave space for Dr. Schneider. This didn’t take as long as we
expected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I had a very bad headache all
day. I caught the </span><span lang=EN-GB>5.10pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> train
and travelled home with Iris and Pat. From the station I came up </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Victoria Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>, then as I came past the
Walkers’ I thought, “How funny if Helen were to come home tonight instead of
tomorrow. She wouldn’t get my letter” (I had scribbled one at tea-time), and
then there was Helen coming up the road towards me!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I stayed with Helen a few
minutes. Tonight and Friday night is the K.E.S. Carol Service, and Helen said
she expected she would come, but now she has changed her mind, though she is
home till December 27th.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was very tired when I got in,
so I decided to have a bath and go to bed. However, after a bath my headache
was much better, so I came down again, ate egg and chips for tea and did a full
evening’s work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Nothing unusual happened at
work. At dinner time I bought some more Christmas cards. I had arranged to meet
Mam outside Smith’s at </span><span lang=EN-GB>12.40pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>
and we went to Lewis’s where I bought Helen a pair of Nylon stockings – <i>Pex</i>
brand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to Club tonight so that
I could be included in the football team tomorrow. Helen went to Choir Practice
and afterwards we went a short walk. I told Helen I wasn’t now taking her to
the Concert on Tuesday as we had planned. If she cannot give up an evening’s
Choir Practice to come to a Carol Service after saying she would come, then I
am not giving up the Department’s Christmas Party to take her to the concert.
Helen still takes me for granted but if friendship is worth while it is no use
one giving, the other taking. Helen is making a fool of me by thinking just of
herself, though she doesn’t realise she is being thoughtless. She said she was
sorry and would not do it again.</span></p>

the ’bus and got off at the G.P.O. to buy stamps. I spent the morning working
and inevitable talking to Louie. Louie is obviously a real Christian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got home at </span><span lang=EN-GB>1.0pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> and in the afternoon played outside-left
for the Club in a [</span><span lang=EN-GB>Solihull</span><span lang=EN-GB> and
District Youth] League game v. Water Orton. Our opponents were 30 minutes late.
We should have scored 5 within twenty minutes but, quite unnecessarily, we lost
the initiative and it was 0-0 at half-time. In the second half we scored 4 and
missed a penalty, and conceded one. It was a poor game, and the game got out of
hand because Len Bowden wasn’t sufficiently firm as referee, and a Water Orton
supporter fancied himself in control. The pitch was inches deep in mud and we made
the mistake of keeping the ball close.</span></p>

presence if only to help her escape the attentions of Donald Holloway. Philip
Mead and Anne no longer go out with each other, so Anne has gone back on the

holding hands, I guessed someone would hear about it, and sure enough at Church
this evening Freda refused to speak to me! Perhaps it was because I didn’t hold
Freda’s hand last time I took her home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben took both today’s
services. This morning’s service included the dedication of a lectern memorial
to Mrs. Jameson and Miss Marshall, and a baptism [Stephen John Baines, also Roy
Matthews]. We sang 132 <i>As with gladness men of old</i>, 751 <i>See </i></span><i><span
  lang=EN-GB>Israel</span></i><i><span lang=EN-GB>’s gentle shepherd stand</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB>, 831 <i>Give me the wings of faith to rise</i>, 122 <i>Brightest
and best of the sons of the morning</i>, and 140 <i>God from on high hath heard</i>.
The reading was from Titus 2:11- 3:7. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Dibben’s sermon was on Luke
2:25-26, “And, behold, there was a man in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Jerusalem</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting
for the consolation of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Israel</span><span lang=EN-GB>,
and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And it was revealed unto him by the Holy
Ghost, that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.” For
the Jews the coming of Messiah signified the salvation of God’s people and the longed-for
reign of God on earth. Behind the Christmas story we must see the poverty and
squalor in which the people lived, the duplicity of Herod, the suffering of the
innocents. In the world today Christ’s conception of love has gone, and people fail
to see that God is at work in everything. The people in the Christmas story –
Simeon, just and devout, Zacharias and Elisabeth, righteous before God and
blameless – were ordinary folk like us, but they experienced God working in
their lives, and through the scriptures their names live on.             </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After dinner I cycled to John
Winrow’s and asked him to get me tickets for Tuesday’s “Music You Love” concert
at the Town Hall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight we had a beautiful Service

<p class=retrospect><span lang=EN-GB>Mr. Dibben took both today’s services but tonight’s
was the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols. In the margin of the Diary I have
penned in my usual green ink (erroneously and obviously at a later date) the
hymns for tonight’s service as being: 959 Sing to the great Jehovah’s praise,
958 O God, the Rock of Ages (sung to the tune of The Church’s one foundation),
857 God has given us a Book full of stories, 607 O God of Bethel, by whose
hand, 956 Come, let us anew our journey pursue. As three of these hymns come
from the “Opening and Closing of the Year” section and one from the “For Little
Children” section, they must have been sung at the morning service on </span><span lang=EN-GB>Sunday 2nd January 1955</span><span lang=EN-GB>. This is now confirmed by
my discovery of the original, undated, pencilled notes for the service on
which, erroneously, I have written in green ink “19/12/54 6.30pm J.V.D.” This
contains not only the above list of hymns, but also the readings from
Deuteronomy 26:16-19 and Romans 12, which were the appointed lessons for </span><span lang=EN-GB>2nd January 1955</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The preacher was not Mr. Dibben
but The Reverend W. Russell Shearer M.A, President of the Methodist Conference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning I caught the
8.45am train as usual and before going to work bought my last two cards – for
Helen, and Anne. I got these from Osborn’s in Ethel Street. I got in at 9.30.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            During the dinner hour I went
to the <i>Birmingham Mail</i> offices and ordered a photograph which I am
giving Mam; I also went to Pope’s to get Dad’s <i>Conway Stewart</i> pen
repaired. I also had a look at some matching propelling pencils.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Tonight Helen and I went to the
“Music You Love” concert at the Town Hall. Our seats were L11 and 12 in the
Upper Gallery. The programme was of Ballet music, George Weldon conducting:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Suite – <i>La Boutique

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was almost one o’clock
before I got into bed this morning, but I didn’t feel particularly tired when I
got up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went on the 8.45am train with
Anne as usual. I spent the morning washing up and tidying up the lab for the
afternoon. Only Hilary and Pam were in but Audrey came about 11.0am.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After lunch I fetched my photo
order from the <i>Mail</i> offices and looked at the text-books in the Midland
Educational.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The party didn’t start till
late. First Mrs. Smith couldn’t come, then Dr. French. Audrey couldn’t, Alan
was late and Dr. Schneider was later still. When we did begin the festivities
there were seven of us including Peter Ranwell and Janet. There were cakes,
mince-pies, Mam’s shortbread, marshmallows, fruit and cream and trifle. Dr.
Schneider also brought a bottle of Barsac and some orange squash, and there was
also tea. George Watts was operating and unable to come so we saved him some
food, and we took a lot of food to Ward 14 for the patients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            We exchanged presents – Pam
gave me a box of stationery, Alan gave Dr. Schneider a tie and had a book
subscription from Hilary. After tea in the office Peter and Alan amused us with
a “telepathy” act. We also passed a pair of scissors round … Crossed or
Uncrossed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Kipper called for me at 7.0 and
we spent the evening carolling in Edgbaston. Tonight we had Barbara from whose
house we started, Mim, Jennifer, Kipper, Phil, Mike Antcliff and myself. Jill
couldn’t come. We sang in a number of roads round and about Hagley Road and the
Ivy Bush. At one house we had a £1 note and part of a 2lb box of chocolates. We
also called at Perry Haynes’ house – he was part-time Art master during my
latter K.E.S. days. About 9.30 Phil and Mike took Mim home on the ’bus, while
the remaining four of us went back to Jennifer’s for beer, cider, coffee,
biscuits, cakes and pies. We sang four or five more carols but it was well
after eleven and we were rather merry and kept on laughing. At last we took
Barbara home in the car and Kipper dropped me on the corner just after
midnight. It had been a highly enjoyable evening, and we raised £2 19s 11d,
making our total at least £5 10s 0d.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            This morning my train was, I
thought, on time for once, but after I had been on it a few minutes I realised
it was the 8.40 to Moor Street. Anyway, I missed Anne, and funnily enough I
missed her again at dinner-time. I caught the 12.40 (first stop Acocks Green,
12.48) and Anne the 12.50. Pat Welch was on my train.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was originally intended that
we have Christmas Eve off, but so as to have the whole of next week we worked
today till midday. First I tidied up after the party and washed up the
crockery. I also went up to the kitchen and cleaned the animal cages. By
12.0pm, with Pam’s help, everything was washed up and left tidy for the
holiday. Hilary went early, after getting rid of the rats and pigeons. Dr.
Schneider came in for five minutes to make a ’phone call. After Pam and I had
got our wages I said Goodbye to her. Pam is leaving now to have a baby at the
end of February. I hoped it would be a boy or a girl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The Thomases had a baby
daughter at 1.10am on Wednesday. She will be called Angela Marjorie [spelt
Angela Margery Thomas in June 1955 <i>Messenger</i> recording her christening
on 20th March]. She weighed 6lb 15oz.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I was thinking, I had not had a
Christmas Eve at home since 1950.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The Walkers went to Stratford
tonight. Helen came at 6.0pm and brought me a card and a present which she made
me promise not to open till tomorrow. I gave Helen her present.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At 7.30 I went carol-singing
(fourth time in five nights) with the Y.P.F. We sang in Victoria Road, </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Sherbourne Road</span><span lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Broad
  Road</span><span lang=EN-GB> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Warwick Road</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. It wasn’t a very good evening and unfortunately degenerated into a
necking party. At one house we were invited in for biscuits and tea. At the end
of the evening I took Anne home and got in myself about </span><span lang=EN-GB>10.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Mam and Dad had just got back from
seeing Ivor Novello’s <i>Dancing Years</i> on Ice at the Hippodrome. Dad had
the tickets from Stan who recently broke off his engagement and no longer
needed them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I went to bed at five minutes

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I got up at </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.20am</span><span lang=EN-GB> in time to go to the </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB> Holy Communion at Church. When I got back I
took Mam and Dad [a cup of] tea in bed and unwrapped my presents – a
waist-jacket, Diary, framed photograph from Mam and Dad; a <i>Filmgoer’s Diary</i>
and Tootal tie from Clarice and Julia, and a lovely tie-clip from Helen. Freda
gave me a party game. Mam and Dad had already given me a new shaving outfit for
Clevedon, and Old Edwardians badge and tie, and there was also my box of
stationery from Pam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I gave Mam and Dad a copy of the
same photograph they gave me. I bought Clarice and Julia purses to match their
new handbags.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>10.0am</span><span lang=EN-GB> I went to the morning service. Mr.
Dibben’s text [sermon] was on Luke 2:32, “A light to lighten the Gentiles, and
the glory of thy people </span><span lang=EN-GB>Israel</span><span lang=EN-GB>”.
A decision about Christ’s coming and purpose was inescapable. Great Christian
men risked staking their trust in Him because they were confronted by facts
which were inescapable. It has been said that “All true living is meeting”. It
is easy to make a religion of life without God. We must meet God for ourselves.
David Hume said, “You don’t believe in God? He believes in you!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            The hymns were 120 <i>Christians,
awake, salute the happy morn</i>, 143 <i>Good Christian men, rejoice</i>, 122 <i>Brightest
and best of the sons of the morning</i>, and 125 <i>O little town of </i></span><i><span
  lang=EN-GB>Bethlehem</span></i><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            After the service Donald
Holloway, Phillip Mead and I walked home with Freda. Freda is speaking to me
again!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I spent the afternoon writing

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I did not wake till after ten
this morning. Mr. Harvey [Rev. E. Bryan Harvey] was the preacher at this
morning’s service. We sang 141 <i>To us a child of royal birth</i>, 6 <i>Eternal
Power, whose high abode</i>, 860 <i>Away in a manger</i>, 135 <i>Stupendous
height of heavenly love</i>, and 143 <i>Good Christian men, rejoice</i>. The
lessons were Isaiah 41:8-20 and John 4:1-4. His sermon was on Colossians 1:24-29.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>1.</span></b><span lang=EN-GB> As
Christians we can <b>rejoice in suffering</b>. We speak of the mystery of
suffering. A mystery is something hidden, secret, and therefore attractive; we
love mystery stories. The Bible is like a mystery story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>2</span></b><span lang=EN-GB>. In any
story there is <b>a plan from the beginning</b>, a pattern there. This is true
of God who is the Great Author. We who understand the mystery can conceive an
intention there – how much more must God be able? God is not passive. If we
fail, i.e. hinder God, we do not stop Him. God has faith in Himself. God has a
plan for us, He is at work in us this moment. God called us to Church. There is
something to do for Him. If we don’t do it, another will. God is the Author who
knows where He is going. God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>3</span></b><span lang=EN-GB>. We live
in <b>a period when all is going wrong</b>, and almost lose faith in the
Author. Life is dark sometimes. We face sin, suffering and tragedy. But love is
the secret of the Universe (Rudyard Kipling) and we see God’s love revealed in
the birth of Jesus. Reason is powerless before grievances. Logic fails for a
person who is afraid. But love doesn’t fail. Only love can overcome sin and
suffering, therefore the answer is Jesus Christ. Love – God’s love, not ours –
is the Answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            At tonight’s service conducted
by Mr. Terry [Rev. William S. Terry] we sang 142 <i>Let earth and heaven
combine</i>, 127 <i>Cradled in a manger, meanly</i>, 125 <i>O little town of
Bethlehem</i>, 129 <i>While shepherd watched their flocks by night</i>, and 135
again. The lessons were Isaiah 43 and Philippians 2:1-8.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mr. Terry preached on John </span><span lang=EN-GB>1:14</span><span lang=EN-GB>, “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
among us. God wanted to give us a tangible expression of Himself, and therefore
He sent Jesus who was the Word made flesh. The inadequacy of modes of
expression has led to the creation of great poetry, music and art; the great
vision is expressed in great works, especially in praising God in hymns and
music. There is a poverty in words which lack sympathy, What is required is a
loving heart, a seeing mind and spiritual experience. We must become a fitting
medium for Jesus to be revealed in us. The question God faced was where to find
a fitting medium to express what He wanted to say. That is why He sent Jesus,
full of truth and grace. God gave of Himself in giving Jesus, and there must
always be a measure of giving one’s self with one’s gift. That is why we choose
our Christmas cards so carefully. In Christ God has given Himself for <i>me</i>.
It is sad if a gift is given without response. The gift of God must be
responded to. We must give ourselves to Him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            It was an excellent sermon.</span></p>

a note of the music played. But the concert was an extra one, and not detailed
in the Syllabus. I also got muddled up with the concert I went to on September

over the place trying to find the programme. After quite a search again this
morning I found it inside an unused K.E.S. note-book in my bedroom, and solved
the mystery. About dinner time I wrote a short letter to John, and sent him the
<i>Birmingham Weekly Post</i>’s review of the Mexican film <i>The Bandit</i>
which he told me to see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            John gave me a large number of
record envelopes as few of my records have packets to them. In the afternoon I
went down the village, but apart from meeting David Walker, nothing happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Mam stayed in all day waiting
for Dr. Gough who came at </span><span lang=EN-GB>6.30pm</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. About </span><span lang=EN-GB>7.00pm</span><span lang=EN-GB> Mam
went into the shed and found Dinah with as pup! I phoned the vet in case one
was needed (it wasn’t) then waited in the shed for the rest of the litter to
arrive. The second pup was born at </span><span lang=EN-GB>8.30pm</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. I spent over an hour writing to Helen.</span></p>

<p class=topic><span lang=EN-GB>Memories of 1954</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Dinah did not have another pup
after the first two, and it was </span><span lang=EN-GB>one o’clock</span><span
lang=EN-GB> when I got into bed. I did not get up until </span><span lang=EN-GB>12.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. Before dinner I listened to <i>The Goon
Show</i>, and this afternoon I have completed my letter to Helen and been to
the Post Office to post it. I took Ginger down the village with me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            All being well, tonight I shall
be going to the Club’s New Year’s Eve Social and then to the Watchnight Service
at </span><span lang=EN-GB>11.15pm</span><span lang=EN-GB>. My mind goes back
to this time last year. Tonight Helen won’t be there, and I feel a dull ache in
my heart because I miss her so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            In many ways 1954 has been the
most important year of my life. I started work and settled down to the routine
of College life. I passed my exams. I had articles published in the <i>Birmingham
Mail</i>, the <i>Birmingham Weekly Post</i>, the <i>Birmingham News</i>, the <i>Birmingham
Gazette</i> and <i>Youth</i>; worked on a couple of plays, had <i>Going the Rounds</i>
approved and <i>Music from the Movies</i> broadcast by the B.B.C. I became a
member of the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Methodist</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Church</span><span lang=EN-GB> in June, began preaching first with
the Youth Team and then as a Local Preacher.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            So in many ways I grew up more
in 1954 than in any other year. But the most important thing was that I fell
deeply in lore with Helen – that had a greater impact on me than anything else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            There are so many memories I
shall always cherish … Going to see <i>Trouble in Store</i> at the Olton, when
Michael Brown took Freda and half the Club went … queuing two hours to see <i>The
Robe</i> … the night we went to the Bristol and Helen’s heart beat so fast …
walking to Knowle in the pouring rain … standing by the canal locks in the
stillness and silence of a summer evening … seeing Helen in her tennis shorts …
going to a concert for the first time together … distributing National
Children’s Home envelopes in Station Road … meeting Helen on the 1A ’bus on
Fridays … the look on her face the first time I kissed her …[code words] …
Going to London with the Mission … the time Helen plucked up courage … the
first time I saw her after returning from Margate … seeing her curled up in a
chair, and wearing odd socks when she had a bad foot … saying Goodbye at Church
… taking her back to Dudley Road at ten past eleven – so very many memories
which mean so much. We had our disagreements and upsets, hurt each other and
lost our tempers, but I love her in a way no words can do justice to. Now I am
praying that Helen may come to love me if it be God’s will, and that she will
be my wife one day. I know with absolute certainty that it was a Divine
Providence which brought us together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I don’t think I shall ever
again go to a cinema alone. In 1954 we went to the cinema thirty times, and I
took Freda once. The most outstanding films were <i>The Robe</i>, <i>How to
Marry a Millionaire</i>, <i>The Moon is Blue</i>, <i>Doctor in the House</i>, <i>Knock
on Wood</i>, <i>Life in the Arctic</i>, <i>Kiss Me Kate</i>, <i>Dial M for
Murder</i> and (from 1953) <i>Roman Holiday</i>. What great entertainment these
were! In the “very good” class were <i>The Caddy</i>, <i>Trouble in Store</i>
and <i>The Glass Web</i>, <i>Money from Home</i>, <i>Androcles and the Lion</i>,
<i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i>, <i>The Runaway Bus</i>, <i>Forbidden Cargo</i>,
<i>Conflict of Wings</i>, <i>Happy Ever After</i>, <i>The Sea Around Us</i> and
<i>The Belles of St. Trinian’s</i>. And I liked </span><i><span lang=EN-GB>Park</span></i><i><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span></i><i><span lang=EN-GB>Plaza</span></i><i><span
lang=EN-GB> 605</span></i><span lang=EN-GB>, <i>Beneath the Twelve-Mile Reef</i>,
<i>Susan Slept Here</i>. I didn’t like <i>Vicki</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Performances I liked. Everybody
in <i>The Robe</i>, Marilyn Monroe in <i>How to Marry a Millionaire</i>, Alan
Young in <i>Androcles and the Lion</i>, the cast of <i>The Moon is Blue</i>,
the students in <i>Doctor in the House</i>, Danny Kaye in <i>Knock on Wood</i>,
David Niven in <i>Happy Ever After</i>, Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn in <i>Roman
Holiday</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            One last film I should mention
as being especially memorable was <i>I Beheld His Glory</i>. Now </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Birmingham</span><span lang=EN-GB> is awaiting another religious film,
one that has caused much controversy already, <i>Martin Luther</i> which comes
to the Scala on January 9th. I also want to see <i>The Billy Graham Crusade</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            I’ve followed radio and TV even
less this year. Offhand, I do not recall seeing a good play except <i>1984</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            As usual I have followed the
weather very closely and shall probably remember 1954 as atrocious. We had
35.345 inches of rain, 6.570 inches in the first quarter (1st January to 31st
March), 6.640 in the second, 10.010 in the third and 12.125 inches in this
final quarter up to and including today (we have had not a drop of rain since
before Christmas). The wettest days were Friday 5th November (0.945 inch) and Wednesdays
28th July and Friday 20th August (both 0.735 inch). By comparison only 0.625
inch of rain fell during the whole of April.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>            Looking at the corresponding
figures for sunshine for the four quarters they are 167.2 hours of sunshine
(January-March), 371.7 hours (April-June), 392.8 hours (July-September) and
182.6 hours (October-December. We had 87 sunless days during the year (29, 7,
13 and 38 for the four quarters respectively). There was not a glimmer of
sunshine for 6 consecutive days 14th-19th February and 18th-23rd November, and
only <i>12 minutes</i> of sunshine in 10 days 13th-22nd March. The sunniest
days of the year were Thursday 24th June (Midsummer Day) with 12.1 hours and
Saturdays 19th and 26th June with 10.3 hours. The hottest day of the year was
80 degrees on Wednesday 1st September, and that week Sunday 29th August to
Saturday 4th September was the warmest, the mean maximum daily temperature being
69.7 degrees. </span></p>

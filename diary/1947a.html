<h3>WEDNESDAY 1st JANUARY 1947

<table width="750" border=0><tr valign="top">

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This year I have got a &ldquo;Cromwell Series&rdquo; Diary from Woolworth&rsquo;s. It measures 4 <SUP>1</SUP>/<SUB>8</SUB> x 2&frac34; ins, and has a blue cover with rounded corners. Inside the front cover there is a Map of Europe and inside the back a Map of The World, prepared for D. Harper &amp; Co. Ltd., Copyright, George Philip &amp; Son, Ltd.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 17 pages of notes which include Calendars for 1946 and 1948 (Leap), sleeve markings of Officers of the Royal Navy, shoulder-strap markings of Officers of the Army, and rank badges of the R.A.F. There is then a page of First Aid Hints, then four (unnumbered) pale blue pages listing all the London theatres and a map of the Underground.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Following this there are notes on what to do in the garden each month, and Hints for Health and Comfort, including a lump of loaf sugar which will instantly stop hiccoughs if I get them, and also how to blow my nose. I must also remember not to rub Potassium Chlorate tablets together or strike them as this will cause them to ignite or explode. They should not be carried by occupants of aircraft. [We do not seem to have any of these, as we only take Aspro or Yeast-Vite.] There are also hints on stopping flies and midges, and the destruction of Earwigs, Ants, Beetles, Cockroaches, Rats, Mice, Wasps etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are pages giving the Equivalents of Metric and Imperial Weights and Measures, the Morse Code [including V for Victory, which is dot dot dot dash] and a page of Mems. including my Ration Book Number, which is JE&nbsp;150040, and weight, which was 5 stones 5 lbs. on 25 Nov.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At the back of the Diary are 6 pages for Cash Account 1947 which I am using for my Camp Hill marks, and five pages for addresses. [During the year I am going to write in the addresses of Children&rsquo;s Hour, Broadcasting House, London, W.1., of Mr. A. Handley, Colin Gilbraith and John Wilkins, and of &ldquo;Midland Magazine&rdquo;, B.B.C., Broad Street, Birmingham.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been a lovely sunny day with a hard frost &mdash; very cold for the &ldquo;squatters&rdquo; who have camped at Church Road, Yardley, and Billesley Common. The Government has today taken over the Coal Mines so perhaps we shall soon have more coal.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There is also a prisoner-of-war camp at Sutton Coldfield and two Germans have escaped!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The King has today made Ralph Richardson a Knight. He is 44 and before becoming a film star he was an actor at the Repertory Theatre in Station Street.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is the first New Year without Granma Williams. She died 5&frac12; weeks ago on Sunday November 24th and we all miss her very much. I have stuck at the top of the Memoranda page of my Diary the announcement of her death which I wrote for the <I>Birmingham Mail</I>:&mdash;</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[Later, after Grandad has died and Fred too, I shall be given the photographs which hung in their back room at 23 Pretoria Road. I do not know when they were taken. Granma is wearing what appears to be an Edwardian dress. She was born in 1882, so would have been about 27 or 28 in 1910, and Grandad a year older.]<BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning we had the first snowfall this year. It was very thick and has blanketed the country. The buses could not get up Hill Street and had to be diverted. Two buses collided at Handsworth. It is freezing hard.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Granma would have been 64 today. It is 6 weeks ago yesterday since she died, of emphysema. She and Grandad had been married 41 years. [They were married at St. Ann&rsquo;s Church, Nottingham, on Sunday 7th May 1905 when they were both 22. Ernest Alfred Williams was living at 5 Franchise Terrace, off Westminster Street, Nottingham, at the time and Minnie Jane Bower was lodging at 2 Simon&rsquo;s Terrace, nearby. They subsequently moved to 1 Franchise Terrace, where Clarence Williams, their second child, was born on Wednesday 27th February 1907.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Minnie Jane Bower was born at Little Hallam, Ilkeston, on Saturday 6th January 1883 and seems to have been the 10th of about 23 children born to William Bower (1838&ndash;1910) and Ann Bircumshaw (1844&ndash;1894), also of Ilkeston.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;D.H. Lawrence, the novelist and poet, was born 3 miles away at Eastwood on Friday 11th September 1885 when Minnie Jane was 2. He knew the Bowers and the Bircumshaws and used their names in his novels and short stories. Mrs. Bower appears in <I>Sons and Lovers</I>, and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bower represent his parents in <I>The Miner at Home</I>, Jack Bower being Bert Lawrence himself. Another of his stories is <I>Delilah and Mr. Bircumshaw</I>.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Spring Term began this morning. We had to be at King Edward&rsquo;s Grammar School, Camp Hill, for 10.0am. A thaw has set in so the roads were very slushy. Our 1B form room is upstairs overlooking Stratford Road, in the protruding part of the building. The School is very old as it was built in 1883 in the days of Queen Victoria.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I took the Entrance Examination last year it was from one of the other rooms where I sat by the window and, if I stood up, I could see the L.M.S. goods trains going by. I always hope to see a passenger train but they don&rsquo;t use this line. All we ever seem to see is 0&ndash;6&ndash;0 locos.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today I went to St. Andrews to see Birmingham City&rsquo;s match v Southampton. Blues won 3&ndash;1. Birmingham City:&mdash; Merrick; Duckhouse, Jennings; Harris, Turner, Mitchell; Mulraney, McIntosh, Trigg, Bodle, Edwards.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The pitch was covered by three inches of snow, which was left on to prevent the ground freezing over. It was, however, a very good match. Trigg got a couple of goals, the other goal coming from Mulraney. McIntosh, playing his first game [after being transferred from Wolverhampton Wanderers] was unlucky not to score.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Bradley, Saints&rsquo; inside-left, scored Southampton&rsquo;s goal in the second half. [Alf Ramsey was right back. He is going to be Manager of England when they win the World Cup in 1966, and &mdash; as Sir Alf Ramsey &mdash; will be Blues&rsquo; Manager from September 1977 until March 1978.] There were about 35,000 at the match.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school I walked down Stratford Road as usual, under the railway bridge, then crossed over Kyotts Lake Road (where the tram depot is) and went to the Stamp Shop. They had got the stamps of the Royal Family&rsquo;s visit to South Africa so I bought the set for Bechuanaland Protectorate. They are the 1d red which shows the King in Naval uniform, the 2d green with the King and Queen, and the 3d blue with Princess Margaret Rose on the left and Princess Elizabeth on the right. The stamps of the Royal Family are very attractive. They have the words &ldquo;Royal Visit 1947&rdquo; and are the same for all the countries they are visiting in the Union of South Africa, e.g. Orange Free State.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got home I stuck them in <I>The Wanderer Stamp Album</I> which Dad gave me and which already had a lot of stamps in. There are 128 pages and many of them are already full of stamps, but fortunately it is a &ldquo;loose-leaf&rdquo; album, and I can get extra identical sheets but blank at the top for me to write in the name of the country. There isn&rsquo;t a separate page for Bechuanaland Protectorate &mdash; it is on the same page as Bermuda, British Solomon Islands, British Honduras, British Guiana and Brunei. At the top of the page it says:&mdash; &ldquo;Bechuanaland, a comparatively unknown region in South Africa, annexed in 1895 to the Cape of Good Hope.&rdquo; The stamps look very nice. I have stuck them underneath a King George V red 2c stamp of British Guiana which is overprinted &ldquo;War Tax&rdquo;.</P>

They stayed at the Queen&rsquo;s Hotel, were welcomed by the Lord Mayor (Alderman H.E. Goodby) at the Council House, and made a guest appearance at the Gaumont cinema that night.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been reading <I>Learning to Live</I> and find it is a handbook, written by Louise Morgan from material contributed by members of the Handbook Committee of the Council for Educational Advance. The handbook measures 8&ldquo; x 5&rdquo; and has 36 pages &mdash; they are not numbered but I can pencil the numbers in if I want to. There are photographs on every page, including one of a performance of Bach&rsquo;s <I>Christmas Oratorio</I> at the Town Hall.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought the caption to the picture meant that Camp Hill Grammar School was &ldquo;airy and light&rdquo;, but it means the opposite. Having been built in about 1880, it is not at all airy and light, but very gloomy and depressing compared with the school shown on the previous page. Hartfield Crescent was a lovely school to go to, with Greenwood Avenue to walk down from Shirley Road, and each end of the Crescent opening onto Fox Hollies Road. The school playing fields extend to the back gardens of the houses on Shirley Road, and to the sports field with the path alongside, which connects Shirley Road with Fox Hollies.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This booklet is extremely interesting but I wish I knew where all the photographs were taken, especially the one of girls performing a Dance Drama, &ldquo;Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt&rdquo;. The Handbook is published by the Birmingham and District Council for Educational Advance in connection with Birmingham Education Week, beginning tomorrow and finishing on the 15th.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is three years since the plane crash on the Midland Red &rsquo;bus depot at Digbeth, late on Wednesday night 22nd March 1944. The plane was seen in difficulties flying close by St. Martin&rsquo;s Church, then it nose-dived, hit a Midland Red &rsquo;bus which was outside the depot, and reared up onto a workshop roof where it burst into flames. It was one of our planes &mdash; the Germans were not coming any more &mdash; and the three crew were killed. One of the crew was pulled out by a police sergeant from Digbeth police station across the road, but the man was already dead.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember we all went to Granma&rsquo;s to have dinner on the Saturday and everybody was talking about it. There was a picture in the Thursday night&rsquo;s <I>Evening Despatch</I> of firemen viewing the wreckage, and another in Friday morning&rsquo;s <I>Birmingham Gazette</I>, and Granma said she had shed a few tears for the man.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Friday night&rsquo;s <I>Birmingham Mail</I> said that one of the crew killed was Sergeant Observer Wireless Operator David Huddleston, who, before joining the R.A.F., worked for the Alliance Assurance Co. Ltd. in town, only half-a-mile away from where he was killed. I think that may have been the man Granma was referring to. His father, Mr. R.R. Huddleston, was living at 220 Chelmsley Lane, Marston Green, at the time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There were no other casualties, but four Birmingham City Transport girls had been sitting in the Midland Red &rsquo;bus just before it was hit, but went to have a cup of tea in the Midland Red canteen. I cannot help but think about the plane crash every time we go to church on Sunday or go past on the 44 &rsquo;bus.</P>

Mr. Titt quickly intervened and said, &ldquo;Griffiths, if you think you are going to knock Williams into the middle of next week, you had better think again&rdquo; and told me to put my hands up to defend myself. I did but it made no difference so Mr. Titt stopped it before I got killed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam took us all up town today and we had dinner in Lewis&rsquo;s. As usual, I noticed all the buses in the city centre, especially the quaint A.E.C. Regents, such as No. 492 on the Harborne route.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our Circular Road football team played a team got up by Trevor Gager on a pitch behind Walker&rsquo;s greengrocers in the village. We won 3&ndash;1. I played right-half. Barry Craven kept goal.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was very warm today. The figures given in the <I>Birmingham Mail</I>, recorded at Birmingham Observatory, are:&mdash; Max. 53 degrees, Min. 46 degrees, Sunshine nil, Rainfall 0.19 ins.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I sat the examinations for the High School this morning. It seemed strange working on a Saturday morning. We had the Arithmetic exam from 9.30 until 11.0am and the English from 11.15am until 12.45pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the senior boys from Camp Hill were going to the Film Society meeting at the Broadway Cinema, Bristol Road, to see <I>Film and Reality</I>, postponed from February 22nd because of the fuel crisis.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Birmingham City lost 1&ndash;nil at Sheffield Wednesday this afternoon. They have only scored 13 goals in the last 15 away matches, but 9 of those goals were in 3 matches, so there were only 4 in the remaining 12. They have almost certainly missed promotion to the First Division</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did the remaining exams at the High School this morning and afternoon. First we had a preliminary test then the Intelligence Test followed by History from 11.0 to 11.45am, and Geography from 11.45am to 12.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the dinner hour we played football in the quadrangle.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I did the Algebra and Geometry paper from 1.30 to 3.0pm, and French from 3.15 to 4.45pm. Exam papers</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I only just caught the Special Bus this morning. Nothing happened at school.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got home for 1.15 then cycled to [Grandad&rsquo;s and from there walked to] the Birmingham City v Bolton Wanderers match, which was drawn 0&ndash;0. Birmingham:&mdash; Merrick; Trigg,, Green; Harris (Capt.), McDonnell, Badham; Berry, Stewart, Dailey, Capel, Evans. B&rsquo;ham City were unlucky not to score on four occasions in the first half, but though they attacked for three quarters of the game, they missed their chances and the game just petered out.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[Blues players] Brennan and Ferris played for Ireland, who lost 8&ndash;2 to Scotland at Belfast.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to the Library [and got another Gunby Hadath book.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The last trams are running on Moseley Road tonight. I have seen them every day I have gone to school at K.E.S. and every time we have gone to Cannon Hill Park since we came to live here in 1941.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual, nothing at all happened at school. Nothing ever does as far as I can see [but the <I>Birmingham Post</I> has a photo of tram No. 386 entering the depot after its last run on Saturday night].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Physics we carried on with Mechanics. After Choir practice I played football for a few minutes and scored a goal.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Chemistry we did a dull experiment with hard water and soap. In History we spent the period writing a plan for an essay entitled &ldquo;The Causes of the French Revolution, 1789&rdquo;. I came home on the S.B.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I listened to Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s <I>The Importance of Being Earnest</I>. I also went a short walk with Bob to take Ginger &amp; Tess for a stroll.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The School Captain [G.F.B. Laughland] took us for Maths today. We are now all in Prefects&rsquo; Detention for knocking chairs and desks over as we rushed out!!! I came straight home via town.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam went out this afternoon so I cut all the left hand side of the back lawn and part of the right side as well. Tess has ruined both lawn and garden. She has dug a lot of holes in the flower beds but I can&rsquo;t find the soil if I try to fill them in.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;No school tomorrow as it is Speech Day. Our form football team are playing V.A. at Selly Oak Park at 10.30am tomorrow.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On arriving at Selly Oak Park this morning I learned that Chadwin, who was to be our goalkeeper, was taken to hospital yesterday with a suspected fracture of the arm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our team today was:&mdash; Stokes; Stringer, Jarmain; Hopkins, Bennett, Durnell; Gardner, Robertson, Kington (loaned from V.B.), Myself, Fuery. We scored first through Gardner, followed by one from Kington, then I picked up a ball in the middle, side-stepped two V.A. defenders and rammed in a left foot shot. By half-time the score was 3&ndash;3. Soon we were 6&ndash;3 down, then Hopkins scored. With the score 4&ndash;8 I took a corner which Gardner promptly slammed in. We finished up 5&ndash;9. Three V.A. goals went in off the post.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I listened to the 2nd and last part of &ldquo;The Hopkins Manuscript&rdquo;, a Drama Week play about the moon colliding with the earth.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I woke up at five to three this morning to see the total eclipse of the moon. I saw the moon whilst still only partially eclipsed, but I also saw the moon at 3.30am about ten minutes after the eclipse became total. The moon looked copper-coloured but I was so sleepy that I did not take much notice of the moon at all. It was hardly more than a dream when I got up.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happened at school. I scored two goals at dinner time. I postponed the P.D. [Prefects&rsquo; Detention] until Monday so that I could get home quickly.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I listened to &ldquo;The Crooked Shadow&rdquo;, a Drama Week play. Mam and Dad are at the cinema as usual, [to see <I>Things Happen at Night</I> (A) and <I>Meet Nero Wolf</I> (A) at the Olton. Humphrey Bogart is in <I>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</I> (A) at the Warwick].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happened at school today. I came home on the 1A bus and got home for 1.10pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I cycled to the match [leaving my bike at Grandad&rsquo;s as usual]. Birmingham were playing Portsmouth the 1948&ndash;49 Div. I champions. Blues:&mdash; Merrick; Trigg, Green; Harris, Duckhouse, Badham; Berry, Brennan, Dailey, Capel, Ferris. Portsmouth scored first through Clarke their centre forward. Then Green was injured and went left-wing. Pompey scored twice within a minute after this. Blues playing with ten men held out &amp; were unlucky not to score on two occasions. Result 0&ndash;3. Clarke 2, Reid 1.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to the Library and got myself two books. [If I had known earlier, I would have gone from there to St. Mary&rsquo;s, only two minutes away, to hear Bishop Barnes. He has been to rededicate the Church now that the rebuilding is finished. It was bombed on Tuesday night 10th December 1940, exactly 3 weeks after we were bombed out from Alum Rock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We came to live here in Acocks Green a few months later and I remember going down the village and seeing most of St. Mary&rsquo;s roof missing and the windows shattered. (I have read somewhere that the next Sunday&rsquo;s services were held at the Warwick Cinema and subsequently at Acocks Green School). But during 1941 the north aisle was repaired, roofed over and partitioned off, and Julia was christened there by the Vicar, Rev. P.J. Kelly, on Sunday 5th October.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Kelly, who has been at St Mary&rsquo;s since 20 June 1931, has produced a souvenir booklet for tonight&rsquo;s service entitled <I>Out of the Ashes &mdash; the Bombing and Rebuilding of St. Mary&rsquo;s Acocks Green</I>. He tells how the bomb crashed through the roof at 8.20pm that night, leaving a large crater in the floor just in front of the lectern. He had been standing on that very spot, taking a Confirmation class, when they heard the Air Raid Siren and he sent them to shelter. The lectern was demolished, the pulpit ruined, the screen reduced to matchwood, and the stained-glass windows utterly destroyed, except for the magnificent East Window designed by Edward Burne-Jones (1833&ndash;98) O.E.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The pitch of the roof has now been lessened, tiles substituted for slates, and the walls heightened, with improved clerestory windows to let more light in as the Church used to be so dark. The cover of the booklet also shows St Mary&rsquo;s with a <I>tower</I> which it is hoped to build! The Church, built in 1866 and extended in 1882 and 1891-2, has never had one, even though it was part of the architect J.G.Bland&rsquo;s original design.]&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I finished reading <I>Against the Clock</I> by Gunby Hadath all this morning. It was another excellent book. It rained from midnight till ten o&rsquo;clock but there is only 44 days water supply in the Elan Valley. The papers say we may have to queue for water soon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tess looks like a rabbit when she pricks her ears up. She should look more like one now. Yesterday she stole some rabbit in the kitchen and gobbled it up, bones and all. She was rather ill afterwards.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I did some prep, then tonight I stuck some photos in my soccer album.</P>

[A dozen or more of us hapless victims had to stand still for half-an-hour outside the entrance to Big School, not even <I>breathing</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On the way home I went to the Post Office and got the set of four new stamps, 2&frac12;d, 3d, 6d and 1/-, which have been issued today for the 75th Anniversary of the Universal Postal Union 1874&ndash;1949. I stuck them on the envelope I had done, addressed to myself, but decided not to post it]. I got home at 5.30pm.</P>

At Half time we led 11&ndash;nil and we finished up winners by 26&ndash;0.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today was a whole holiday in honour of &ldquo;our pious founder, King Edward VI&rdquo; [whom we remember every day in Prayers:&mdash;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>We give Thee most humble and hearty thanks, O most merciful Father, for our pious Founder, King Edward the Sixth, and for all our Governors and Benefactors, by whose benefit this whole School is brought up in godliness and good learning: and we beseech Thee to give us grace to use these Thy blessings to the glory of Thy Holy Name, that we may answer the good intent of our religious Founder, and become profitable members of the Church and Commonwealth, and at last be partakers of Thy Heavenly Kingdom; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The prayer is a very ancient one, long in use at Winchester whose &ldquo;pious founder&rdquo; was William of Wykeham. Thomas Arnold (who wrote <I>Tom Brown&rsquo;s Schooldays</I>, 1857) was there as a boy, and adapted it for use at Rugby School when he became its Head Master. His prot&eacute;g&eacute; James Prince Lee further adapted it when he became Chief Master at King Edward&rsquo;s in 1838 &mdash; there is a painting of him in Big School.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not do much this morning. I went down the village to help Mam with the shopping.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went to the Ideal Home Exhibition at Bingley Hall. It was a good exhibition but last year&rsquo;s was twice as good. While there I bought a bottle of Transprint, a U.S.A. liquid which enables one to reprint photographs both in colour and black and white. It is super to be able to reproduce a photo in my soccer album without having to use glue to stick it in.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In English we discussed the Prevention of Road Accidents. French lasted until 2.50pm when we assembled in Big School for a concert given by Eileen &amp; Joan Lovell (Pianists). The concert included <I>Sonata in D</I> by Mozart.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the 1A bus with Don Tipper.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I blancoed gaiters etc. &amp; wrote up five pages of notes on Hydrogen.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning Mam issued a summons against Mrs. Jenkins [our neighbour at 149 Circular Road] for assault. The case comes up next Wednesday.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In English on Fridays we read Shakespeare&rsquo;s <I>Twelfth Night</I> (unfortunately). In Geography I was muchly commended by Mr. Whalley for my hair-do!!!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I played football at dinner time then we had History &amp; Maths tests. For History we went to the Biology Laboratory &amp; Mr. Ballance took the period.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I caught the Special Bus home and tonight I did a little homework &amp; also took down the latest weather readings [from the <I>Birmingham Mail</I>].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is almost nine o&rsquo;clock. Mam, Dad and Bob have gone out. I am going to bed in a minute or two.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today was the Birmingham University Carnival Day &amp; we were &ldquo;invaded&rdquo; on the S.B. by two gay carnivalists clinking their tins. At school also we were &ldquo;visited&rdquo; during French with Mr. Gosling. Mr. Gess was absent today so Mr. Bennett took us for Chemistry, together with V.S. in Lecture Room 3. For last period we did a Physics experiment in the Junior Physics Lab.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home by 1A bus.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Only two boys turned up for my [Hartfield Crescent] football meeting this afternoon but I had a game.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandad came for tea.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The clocks were put back an hour tonight [<I>sic</I>, last night] so we had an extra hour of sleep this morning. Before breakfast Clarice &amp; I took Ginger and Tess for a walk along Yardley Road, the [Grand Union] Canal and Woodcock Lane.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast I blew up my football and had a game in the park with Brian [Holliday] and Ken [Gray].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I did homework and this evening I looked through thirty copies of <I>Boy&rsquo;s Own Paper</I>, from June 1947 to November 1949.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been another fine day again.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed an unusually bright morning this morning but then it was an hour later by changing the clocks. For the past few months I had been going to school at 7.30 really.</P>

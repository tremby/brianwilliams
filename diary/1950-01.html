<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;To my disgust I woke up this morning and realised that I had forgotten to stay awake to let in the new year. I dozed off at a quarter to twelve.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I washed up and then went round the corner and also made a &rsquo;phone call.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went to the park to play football with the boys. This was only my fourth game of football this season. I have played more Rugby instead.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I suppose I ought to make a new year resolution. They are much easier to break than to keep though. My resolution is to do reasonably well at school and to get into a Lower Division in September.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I spent reading &ldquo;Sub-Chaser Jim&rdquo; by Josef Berger [which I had at Christmas]. At 12 o&rsquo;clock I went down the village to do a little shopping for Mam.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon we all went to town and got back at half past five.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up late this morning, about 11 o&rsquo;clock actually, then went straight down to Stratford Road on Bob&rsquo;s bike to get some meat for the brownhounds.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I finished reading <I>Sub-Chaser Jim</I>. It was an exceptionally good book and the scenes where the German U-boats were torpedoed were most realistically described.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I also made a list of my Dinky toys and washed up.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I listened to the radio and had a bath. It has rained continually all day, so I haven&rsquo;t been able to go out with Ginger and Tess.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Before breakfast today I cycled down the village for Mam. Later I played in the street with Clarice and Julia.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner Mam took us to the Olton cinema to see Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo in <I>A Song is Born</I>. This was a fairly good film, I thought. It was a Technicolor film and there were two or three supporting films. In the News Reel there was a film of the events of the past fifty years. When one reviews the such developments as the Aeroplane, Motor Car, Radio and Television, Penicillin and &ldquo;Streptomycin&rdquo;, all of the last half century, one wonders what is in store for the world during the period 1950&ndash;2000.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went down the village. Mam went to Mrs. Moore&rsquo;s [at 54 Ulverley Green Road, Olton] with Clarice and Julia so I stayed in and spent nearly an hour cleaning and dubbining my football boots. Then I read this week&rsquo;s <I>Rover</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I washed up and then helped Mam to take down the Christmas decorations. It rained quite a lot during the afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I helped to tidy up the front room and then went up town for Mam.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At half past one I took Ginger and Tess for a walk. I started from the village [where I took my B.B.C. cheque to the Midland Bank. They advised me to open a Deposit Account so I paid in the cheque for 10/6d and an extra &pound;1 9s. 6d, making &pound;2 altogether.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;From there we walked along Warwick Road through the village and] went as far as the Olton [cinema], then continued along Brookvale Road &amp; St. Bernard&rsquo;s Rd. I carried on past Grange Road [see photo] until I came to Streetsbrook Road. I walked right on until we reached Mapleton Rd. Here I dropped in to see Aunt Daisy. I came home down the Shirley Road and arrived at 4.30 and had a bath almost straight away.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Mam, Dad and Bob have gone out. I have pressed my long trousers and listened to the radio.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t do much this morning except listen to the Omnibus edition of &ldquo;Dick Barton&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon at 3.30 I went to John Maund&rsquo;s party which lasted until about 9.30. Actually, as Kipper [Christopher Martin] was unable to go, [R.C.] Blythe (Spillet) and I were the only guests. We enjoyed ourselves nevertheless.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At Swansea this afternoon Birmingham City were defeated by 3&ndash;nil and knocked out of the 3rd round of the F.A. Cup for the 3rd year in succession.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning Dad and I took Ginger and Tess for a run in the park. After dinner I played some gramophone records, [including the one of my &ldquo;Bird Watching&rdquo; talk on &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Hour&rdquo; 7 weeks ago. I forgot to mention that Mam &amp; Dad got a letter asking whether they wanted a record of the broadcast. It came from Isis Recording Studios on a large disc and says: &ldquo;Play only with lightweight pick-up or trailer needles&rdquo;].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Dad and I minced and broke quite a lot of bread for the dogs&rsquo; meals. Then I had a bath at 8.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been another warm day, in fact the average temperature for the first week of the year was 45.3 degrees compared with 46.6 degrees for the same period in 1948 and 35.0 degrees for 1947. Last year&rsquo;s average was 38.6 degrees.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon Mam took us to see Laurel &amp; Hardy in <I>Air Raid Wardens</I> and Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly in <I>Everybody&rsquo;s Cheering</I> at the Warwick. The latter was in Technicolor.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Mam went to a party. I went to bed at 8.15pm but I came down at 10.15 to hear a special programme to the memory of Tommy Handley, who died just one year today.</P>

Tess was not allowed inside officially but I found a position where I had a good view of the track. Tess did not pay any attention to the hare until she saw Ginger after it.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went down the village twice &amp; wrote a letter, then this evening we all went to the Guild Social at St. Andrews Street. It was five minutes to midnight when I got into bed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[It is my eighth term at K.E.S. and my second term in V.C.]. Third period &mdash; Maths &mdash; we had Mr. Hurrell who is to be our permanent Maths master. We have also moved from Room 59 to 72, the Maths Lab.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. we did drill &amp; then cleaned rifles.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 4.0pm I went to the B.B.C. but in the end there was nothing left for me to do so I shall not be broadcasting on Feb. 4th. I was rather disappointed but I shall have another chance I expect.</P>

Birmingham City:&mdash; Merrick; Trigg, Jennings; Boyd, Badham, Dorman; Stewart, Brennan, Dailey, Evans, Berry. Sunderland were a goal up within four minutes, Shackleton scoring from 20 yards. Birmingham equalised through Dailey just before half time. In the second half Davis shot the winner for Sunderland, who hardly deserved their win. Blues had two thirds of the play &amp; with a bit more luck &amp; more steadiness in front of goal might easily have won.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I ran full speed down the village this morning and I caught the Special Bus with a few seconds to spare.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual nothing much happened at school and I went to town on my way home.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I also bought a copy of <I>Buses Illustrated</I> No. 2. This is the companion paper to <I>Trains Illustrated</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the afternoon I read Enid Blyton&rsquo;s <I>Castle of Adventure</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I washed up and listened to the radio.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The cold frost stopped the University Tower clock at 3.25am today.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I woke up late this morning. After breakfast I fetched my February <I>B.O.P.</I> which is now much larger &amp; has larger print. Then Bob and I cycled to Solihull via St. Bernard&rsquo;s Road.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had a look at some 400 years old houses opposite the Parish Church which are reputed to be haunted by a ghost. We also spent some time inside the [St. Alphege&rsquo;s] church examining it. It is 700 years old.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon Dad and I took Ginger for a run and then I spent quite a time doing Geography prep. which I finished tonight.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The ground was covered with snow this morning. All the way to school the Special Bus literally crawled &mdash; it had to. We arrived eventually at 9.30 but we did not sign the Late Book.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual we had School Choir practice at 12.30 &amp; then I had a school dinner.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Chemistry I worked with [Trevor M.T.] Hopkins.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had a headache when I got home and as I had no prep to do I went to bed at eight o&rsquo;clock tonight.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happened at School today apart from a Maths test.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I called at Harrison&rsquo;s Opticians in town on my way home but I cannot get a new pair of spectacles (if I need them) without a doctor&rsquo;s note.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went down the village to do some shopping. I also read this week&rsquo;s <I>Wizard</I> and <I>Adventure</I> and fitted a Golden Platignum pen nib into my other pen. The original nib was broken when I was at [King Edward&rsquo;s Grammar School] Camp Hill.</P>

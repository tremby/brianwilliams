<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, &mdash; As an engine spotter for more than three years, I can honestly say I have never yet seen an accident caused by this hobby. The majority of spotters do not, as Steam Jacket says, &ldquo;hang about a station for the sole purpose of making a list of numbers&rdquo; &mdash; we learn from experience all about the locomotives themselves.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Many boys are members of the &ldquo;Spotters&rsquo; Club&rdquo; which binds members not to trespass on railway property, nor hinder railway servants in the execution of their duty, and to stop others from doing so. Members do not usually trespass on railway property, etc., because to do so would jeopardise all privileges. There are competitions, special notepaper, a discount on A.B.C. loco books, pen friends in foreign countries, special club greeting cards and visits arranged to places of interest.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Because a few boys make a nuisance of themselves does not mean that everyone does the same. It may be an unprofitable hobby, but certainly it is not dull. &mdash; Yours etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;<I>The Scout</I> has published the letter I wrote, and it has won a Chart:&mdash;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dear Gray Eagle,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought you would like to hear something about our Pack, the 1st Victoria, Birmingham. The Troop was founded in 1910 and the Pack some years later. We have our own Den, which we call &lsquo;Baden Nook&rsquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We meet on Tuesdays, and sometimes we play football in the school playground. You can just imagine 30 Cubs all tearing after the ball, but everyone enjoys it. Afterwards we have Star work, and then a Grand Howl. Several Cubs have their Second Star.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1940 the Pack won the District Championship, and last year we were the runners-up. A football team was started this year, and the team won the first match and lost the next.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;B.D. WILLIAMS, Senior Sixer.</P>

<P>This letter wins a Cub Law and Promise Chart for Sixer Williams&rsquo; pack.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There is a printing mistake in the letter as it was 1946 when we won the District Championship, not 1940. [In my press cuttings album compiled two or three years later, this letter in <I>The Scout</I> is dated July 12th 1948, a Monday, which seems unlikely.]</P>

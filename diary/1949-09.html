<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to get some dog meat on Stratford Road but I was unlucky. I cycled there and when I got back, to Tyseley.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I walked to Tyseley with Clarice and Julia, and at a dump there of broken parts of bicycles and prams, we got a wheel, two mudguards, a couple of small wheels and four axles. We also picked up ten rims of prams (no spokes etc.). The idea was to make a trolley, which I did in two hours. But we never used any of the things in making it. The trolley isn&rsquo;t too bad.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I played football.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Straight after breakfast today I went down the village and got a wooden box from the Co-op. I took one side off and fitted it to the back of the trolley. It makes a fine back and we had some fun playing with the trolley which the rider can steer while seated.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 10.45am I went to Tyseley. I rode Clarice and Julia there separately. Out of seventeen locos. only three were cops (17.65%). No. 6020, <I>King Henry IV</I>, appeared in blue livery, while a quite new engine [Modified Hall Class No.] 6997, <I>Bryn-Ivor Hall</I>, was absolutely filthy. [I believe it is shedded at 82A Bristol Bath Road.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I stayed in this afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is pouring with rain now. Mam and Dad are at the cinema [Hal Monty and Max Bygraves in <I>Bless &rsquo;em All</I> (U) at the Warwick]. Bob is out.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I took Clarice and Julia up town. We got two pillow-cases from Grey&rsquo;s for Mam and we went to Lewis&rsquo;s Enchanted Garden.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We got back home at 2.15pm, then after dinner I cycled to Grandad&rsquo;s and we both went on to the match [walking along Bordesley Green]. B&rsquo;ham. C. lost 1&ndash;nil to Burnley. B&rsquo;ham City:&mdash; Merrick; Badham, Green; McKee, Atkins, Ferris; Stewart, Jordan, Brennan, Capel, Laing. Clarke scored a fine goal in the 13th minute. Blues were unlucky to lose.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home with Grandad [he on the 15B and 11 bus].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight Ginger was 4th from trap 1 in 31.09 secs. (1st race).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tess is growing quickly; though we have only had her three weeks she seems a different dog altogether.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been another beautiful day. The sun has been shining continually and it has been very hot.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went down the village during the morning then at 12.30 we all went to Cannon Hill Park. Tess came with us of course. It was dull at first but the sun came out and stayed out. It was lovely in the park and very hot.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I played football in the [Fox Hollies] park.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner Mam went to Mrs. Roberts&rsquo;, and Clarice and Julia being at school, I called for John [Maund] and we both went for a walk to the park with Tess. Tess walks well now.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I went out to play football.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I came back home I went down the village, had my tea, then played football in the park. We had a good game. Myself, Barry Harvey and Barry [Craven] played Ken [Gray], Clive and Wilf [Rogers] and Brian [Holliday]. And we lost by some terrible margin because while one of us was hanging back as defender, the other was up the field with no one to help him.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was 8.15 when I got back home again.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 9.15am this morning I cycled on to the Stratford Road to get some dog meat but the shop did not open until 10.30 so I had to make a second journey later on. Meanwhile Mam was up town, so Tess was alone in the garden.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 12 o&rsquo;clock I listened to &ldquo;Hullo! Children&rdquo;. Someone was imitating bird and animal calls and Tess pricked up her ears and listened with her head on one side.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I again went to Hartfield Crescent. While there I played football and tried to teach the others to tackle and pass etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I played in the street.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went up town to buy a pair of Stanley Matthews football boots at the Co-op [in High Street]. I bought a good pair, size 6, then waited to see Stan Matthews and Ivor Powell. There were hundreds of people trying to get autographs, so much so that there were police and ambulance men holding back the crowd.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[In the crush, the thin brown paper the boots were wrapped in got so torn that I discarded it, and on the way out of the store, I was stopped on suspicion of stealing the boots. Fortunately I remembered the name of the assistant and was able to convince them that the boots had been paid for. I never got close to the great England player Stanley Matthews but] I got Powell&rsquo;s autograph.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got home I went down the village and met Mr. Parry [my U.M.D. form master] in the Co-op.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went to Hartfield Crescent where 18 boys, members of a football team I have formed, were waiting for me. We had a 9-a-side game. My side won 4&ndash;1. I scored a couple &mdash; one a penalty.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I painted the shed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up fairly early this morning and before breakfast finished painting the shed, all except the side covered by the hedge [on Webb&rsquo;s side] and the back shielded by the ramblers.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 2.30 I decided to cycle on Dad&rsquo;s bike to Warwick. With me were Brian Holliday and Kenneth Gray. We started off at 2.35 and got to Warwick exactly an hour and a half later. By 4.20 we were eating our sandwiches on the bank of the Avon. We spent an hour in Warwick Park and set off at 5.30. We stopped three times on the way back but did the journey in 90 mins. at 12 mph.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;V.C. form room is 176 &mdash; Mr. Jacskon&rsquo;s. Mr. Gess is form master taking us for Physics &amp; Chemistry. We have one new boy &mdash; M. Counsell.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 11.45 was J.T.C. in the playground. I am in B Coy. 7 Platoon. We did mostly drill.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Settling down now at school. First period we had Divinity in which Mr. Kay talked to us. Then we had English with Mr. Vaughan, a new master. After break was P.T. with Mr. King, and fourth, Option 2 in which I went to Mr. Whalley for Geography.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today&rsquo;s subjects were Maths, French (Mr. Gosling: 176), then double Physics (Mr. Gess). At least, supposed to be a double period but last period we assembled in Big School. The Head has decided that everyone is to sit down in prayers as some boys faint.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[Our text-book for French is <I>En France</I> by E. Saxelby, M.A., of Bolton School. It is Book 3 of a series of 4 and has 328 pages, with illustrations by Blam. My copy is rather battered. It belonged to Derek H. Benson who was in Cl.U.M. last year, and Michael J. Thomas had it the year before. Benson has put his name or initials three times on the fly-leaf, also his address: 106 Witherford Way, Birmingham 29, so I have written mine four times in my usual green ink. Benson has also doodled all over pages 142&ndash;3, writing his autograph 15 times and drawing two funny little men: one is named &ldquo;Wunky&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;A.B. Macnab (Fungus)&rdquo; who was also in Cl.U.M. last year. Benson has also left half a pad-page of French prep in the book, with Mr. Gosling&rsquo;s corrections.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school I helped Fred Oxley do a job in the Music Room. We left the school at 1.15pm. Everywhere was locked up.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 2.0 we went to the B.S.A. Flower and Dog Show [at Marston Green]. The flowers exhibited by us won 5 1st prizes, a 2nd, a 3rd and a &ldquo;Highly Commended&rdquo;. Tess was entered in the Dog Show. That was as far as she got.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was an enjoyable afternoon [for Julia&rsquo;s birthday: she is 8 today].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 11.20 today I cycled to Grandad&rsquo;s. When I got back we went to Coleshill. We caught the 1.7 [pm] bus from New Street [just along from the Odeon Cinema, where the Old King Edward&rsquo;s School stood until 1936. The 161 bus took us up Corporation Street and Bull Street, then down Steelhouse Lane, Aston Street and Great Lister Street and past Saltley gasworks; along Washwood Heath Road to the Fox &amp; Goose, Ward End; then by Coleshill Road and Old Chester Road to Castle Bromwich, and Birmingham Road to Water Orton. The journey took 41 minutes.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We got off the Midland Red at Coleshill then walked some distance until we got to Packington Common. At this stage we ate dinner [which we had brought with us], then I explored a sand-pit, at the bottom of which were various pools surrounded by rushes. I discovered hundreds of birds&rsquo; footprints in the mud.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We continued to Little Packington and crossed a river at a ford on the way. Coming back we came across an old railway line with damaged wagons left to rot. A postbox here bore the letters:&mdash; E.VII.R.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[On the return journey the bus entered the city by Aston Street, Stafford Street, and Dale End, arriving at New Street at 7.37pm.] We arrived home tonight at 8.15pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Bennett was absent for Maths today so Gosney a prefect took us (or tried to).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had Choir Practice at 12.30pm and a Chemistry test this afternoon. In History as usual we wrote notes [but Mr. Osborne dictates faster than I can write, and the notes are full of blank spaces which never get filled in. It is putting me off altogether.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the Special Bus.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I wrote up notes and did prep. It is still very close.</P>

<P>P.S. Tonight I listened to the first edition of the new series of <I>Dick Barton, Special Agent</I>. [Dick Barton is now played by Duncan Carse, and there is a new announcer, John Fitchen.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened at school today. Mr. Hurrell took Maths.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time I played football for a few minutes and scored my usual goal.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went down to Eastern Road for the House Rugby Practice. I played Hooker in &ldquo;A&rdquo; team. I am 1st Reserve for the Second team on Thursday.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent all this evening doing homework.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad was notified today that Ginger is in season so she will home very soon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Leeds took Maths. I played football at school and scored a goal.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school I had a short choir practice in the gallery [organ loft]. I came home with Donald Tipper.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I did prep.</P>

<P>P.S. Mam and Dad have just brought Ginger home. She has grown considerably. She made a fuss of us all and Tess nearly wagged her tail off.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got 9 out of 10 for my English prep this morning, top mark.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. we did drill and then we went on to the new playing fields and practised aiming with our rifles.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I played for the House Second XV v Williams&rsquo; House. It was my first House match, but we lost by 14 points to nil.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was Mam and Dad&rsquo;s 16th wedding anniversary today. Tonight they went to the Hippodrome.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is lovely having Ginger back again. Today I took her down the village. She still remembers where the cats live, though she hadn&rsquo;t been down the village for five months. I also took both Tess and Ginger for a walk together.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was cold and drizzly when I set out for school today. Nothing at all happened.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I played football at dinner time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In History we had a test. Highest was about 13 out of 40, I got 9 marks! Mr. Sacret took Maths. I came home on the Special Bus as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight Mam and Dad have gone to the cinema [to see Abbott &amp; Costello in <I>Mexican Hayride</I> (U) and Burt Lancaster in <I>Criss Cross</I> (A) at the Olton]. I have listened to the radio and taken Ginger and Tess out. Bob is in with me.</P>

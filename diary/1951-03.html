<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was announced in the local press this morning that the Head [T.E.B. Howarth] was leaving K.E.S. in 1952. After prayers the Head explained that his job was in some ways not entirely satisfactory for it had &ldquo;so many administrative ramifications&rdquo;. His primary interest lay in teaching and he had to cut down his teaching programme continually. He is returning to Winchester College as Second Master probably at Easter next year.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. today, we did mutual drill and some rifle revision. I came home through town. Nothing else happened all day.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the 1A &rsquo;bus. I stayed in during the afternoon and started to paint a poster.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up early today so that Dad and I could queue for Semi-Final tickets at St. Andrews. Some 200 people stayed overnight at the head of the queue but when we arrived (at 11am) selling had been going on for about half an hour and there were some 25,000 people in front of us. Since there were only 23,000 tickets available, we were unlucky. I felt terribly disappointed. No doubt quite a few of the fortunate people with tickets have not seen one match so far this season.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent the afternoon doing some homework. I also read some of my library book and did some more work on my painting.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing worthy of note here, happened. I just managed to get the Special Bus.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got home I went straight down to the park to collect some specimens of pond life. Ginger came with me. When I had broken the ice, I obtained Canadian Pond Weed, Brooklime, several species of snails, freshwater shrimps and a horse-leech. It was nearly dark when I returned.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was going down to the ground [in Eastern Road] to get some Athletics Standards this afternoon but it rained continually and everything was cancelled. I ate my sandwiches at school and then Lewis and I put the finishing touches to our display of pond life.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was 2.45 when I got home. Apart from fetching my March B.O.P. [<I>Boy&rsquo;s Own Paper</I>] from Dorlings I spent the whole of the afternoon doing homework. I did not go to Cubs this evening as I still had a considerable amount of prep unfinished.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ivor Novello died today. Last night he was on stage at the Palace Theatre, London, in his play <I>King&rsquo;s Rhapsody</I> [which has been running there since 15th September 1949 &mdash; 841 performances], but early this morning he was found dead in his flat above the Strand Theatre. There has been a tribute to him on the Home Service tonight.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;His musical plays such as <I>The Dancing Years</I> [which was revived at the Adelphi on 14th March 1942 and ran for 969 performances] and <I>Perchance to Dream</I> [which opened at the Hippodrome on 21st April 1945 and ran for 1,022 performances] were phenomenally successful, and another of his plays, <I>Gay&rsquo;s the Word</I>, opened at the Saville Theatre on 16th February [and will run for 502 performances].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;His songs are enormously popular &mdash; all very tuneful and memorable, but sentimental, with a rather sad edge to them, like <I>Keep the Home Fires Burning</I> which we all sang during the war. [The war caused the closure of <I>The Dancing Years</I>: it had opened at Drury Lane on 23rd March 1939 and ran for 187 performances.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;He was only 58 and I am sure his untimely death is due to his harsh imprisonment for a trivial offence over petrol coupons: it was a dreadful way to treat a man whose music has inspired millions of people.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today, the Science Exhibition took place and all forms were given two or three periods off in which to go round the exhibition. I myself had the whole day off. Our stand included Daphnia, Cypris [<I>sic</I>], Cyclops, Water snails and Pond weeds. The aquarium contained two goldfish, two sticklebacks, a Crested Newt and a Swan Mussel. One of the most interesting exhibits was a Daphnia under the microscope.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Probably one of the most popular items was the Magnetic Tape Recorder. Almost everyone in the school recorded his voice. There was a working miniature model of a gas-works too.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I read in tonight&rsquo;s paper that General Ali Razmara, the Prime Minister of Persia, was assassinated in Tehran today. He was entering the Maschede Soltaneh mosque when he was shot four times in the head and died instantly. The assassin, a religious fanatic, and his two accomplices tried to commit suicide afterwards but were arrested. The Shah of Persia survived an assassination attempt two years ago. It all reminds me of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been bitterly cold today. In J.T.C. we did mutual drill and we then marched down to the ground to see 2 Platoon give a demonstration of a section attack. We take Cert A. Part 2 in ten days&rsquo; time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went down to the ground to get some standards with Kipper. Someone &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo; my Gym shoes and I had to run in a pair that was hopelessly too large for me. In addition there was a near gale blowing, the track was still very wet and to crown it all my knee was worse than ever. I got the Long Jump &mdash; off a &ldquo;No jump&rdquo; but finally I gave it up. I doubt whether it could have been a worse day for Athletics. weather</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today I finished reading <I>The Perfect Murder Case</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual nothing happened today at school [except for learning the results of last night&rsquo;s Music Competition Finals. D.A. Wright won the Piano, W.B. James the Organ, and R.W.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got my Transport Allowance at Break.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[R.D.] Bailey of the Science Sixth managed to get me a Semi-Final ticket, but being absent from school, passed my ticket to another boy who unfortunately left it at home. However I should be able to get the ticket all being well tomorrow morning.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad also managed to get a ticket and there is then, a slight possibility that we may after all go to Manchester tomorrow.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to the Natural History Society after school to see three films &mdash; &ldquo;Strange Sea Creatures&rdquo;, &ldquo;Life in the Hedgerows&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Great Tit&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went out at 8.0am today and at 8.30 I met the boy in Navigation Street &mdash; complete with a half-crown Semi-Final ticket. I met Dad half an hour later and we then went to buy our rail excursion tickets to Manchester. Thirteen special trains were being run. We caught the last one at 11.30 after queuing for two hours. Altogether 23,000 Blues&rsquo; supporters went by coach, train and car. Almost every one was adorned with various rosettes, scarves and hats of royal blue and white. Hundreds of rosettes were sold outside New Street Station.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our train was half an hour late, arriving at London Road station at 2.15. We ran for a mile after getting off the train and caught a &rsquo;bus in Piccadilly &mdash; Manchester&rsquo;s Bull Ring. There were 20 minutes to go when we arrived at the Maine Road ground and most of the 72,000 people were already inside. However we got in easily enough just in time to see a display by eighty &ldquo;Keep Fit girls&rdquo;. There were terrific cheers when the teams came on to the field. The teams were: B&rsquo;ham C: Merrick; Green, Badham; Boyd, Atkins, Ferris; Stewart, Higgins, Trigg, Smith, Berry. Blackpool: Farm; Shinwell, Garrett; Johnston, Hayward, Kelly; Matthews, Mudie, Mortensen, Brown, Perry.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Blackpool were first to settle down and kept Matthews supplied with the ball but he did not get things all his own way. Blues forwards could not settle down but after about 20 minutes Stewart should have scored. He had only to beat Farm but the goalie just managed to deflect the shot. Berry then shot inches over the bar. Blues never really exerted much pressure but the defence was superb, though Mortensen had been injured after only 10 minutes. The play was fast and exciting however. In the second half, Atkins cleared off the goal line with Merrick beaten, then Merrick pushed a Mortensen header against the bar and the ball was scrambled away. With two minutes to go, Blues came within half an inch of the Cup Final. Stewart shot and the ball hit the foot of the post and bounced out. When the whistle went neither side had scored. It was an exciting enough game though!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We caught the 6.45 train back. It was an hour late in arriving at New Street. When we got home, it was 10.15pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning in J.T.C. I took Cert. A. Part 2. We paraded on the square at 9.30am and the first item was Weapon Training in the Range. I was the first to be questioned. After break we went into the Mechanics Room to do Map-reading. I got over 80% on this.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As part of the mutual drill I had to march the squad down on to the square, give a few more orders and demonstrate the &ldquo;Slope Arms&rdquo;. The last item consisted of various questions on Section Leading and Fieldcraft. We had to wait until 2.0pm for the result. I passed fortunately. Four failed Part 1 and four Part 2.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing else happened all day [except that I have received my school report:&mdash;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This report, and last December&rsquo;s, is a new design, 11&ldquo; x 8&rdquo; (&frac12;&ldquo; longer than previously) with &rdquo;Old English&ldquo; typeface and the coat-of-arms for the heading, with the usual space for name, age, form etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I see from the printer&rsquo;s code &ldquo;A.E.C. 1m/8/50&rdquo; that 1 million of these report forms were printed in August last year. As there are presently 693 boys in the school and three reports per year, these will last for <I>exactly</I> 481 years! On the other hand, if m = 1,000 (as in Latin), then they have lasted only 2 terms &mdash; assuming there were 307 left over from the previous lot &mdash; and they have now run out.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking at my 3 Camp Hill reports I find they have &ldquo;5,000/8/43 A.E.C.&rdquo; in the bottom left-hand corner which means 5,000 forms printed by the same A.E. Company in August 1943. My first report from K.E.S. (December 1947) says &ldquo;4m A.E.C. 3/44&rdquo; in the bottom left-hand corner, meaning 4,000 printed in March 1944. My second report (March 1948) says &ldquo;5m A.E.C. 7/46&rdquo; indicating 5,000 printed in July 1946. 5,000 lasting 8 terms would mean 625 boys. Obviously m = 1,000. Therefore &ldquo;1m&rdquo; on the present reports should read &ldquo;10m&rdquo; &mdash; it is a printer&rsquo;s error!</P>

The attendances have fallen off badly since the beginning of the year &mdash; in fact I&rsquo;ve crossed eight cubs off the roll and we are now only twenty-two strong. No doubt, the bad weather and illness have had a great deal to do with it.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We have, however, twenty-four Scouts now which seems to augur well for the future if we can keep them. Youth Clubs and Boys&rsquo; Brigade are a great attraction it seems.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the afternoon I played football on the field [the strip of land dividing Olton Boulevard East from Victoria Road] with the boys and took Hound out. Mam took Clarice and Julia to town and they did not get back until 6.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been a most miserable day today so far as the weather is concerned. It rained all morning until it stopped at midday. Then it snowed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At about 3.0pm, I went down the village with Ginger to get two loaves and some hot cross buns. The [Hardings] baker did not come until 3.30.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I read a book and listened to a Millwall v Plymouth Argyle commentary on the radio during the remainder of the afternoon. At St. Andrews Blues (5th) drew with Cardiff City (2nd) no goals.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I listened to &ldquo;Any Questions?&rdquo; as usual and took Hound to meet Mam &amp; Dad coming out of the cinema.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We took the opportunity of staying in bed for a little longer this morning. Nothing much happened. I cycled down the village at about twelve.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon Dad and I cycled to the B&rsquo;ham City v Hull City match. B&rsquo;ham C: Merrick; Green, Badham; Boyd, Atkins, Warhurst; Berry, Higgins, Dailey, Rowley, O&rsquo;Hara. In Hull&rsquo;s side were Carter (player-manager) and Franklin. The pitch was one mud heap and was completely waterlogged except for the wings. But Blues played superbly and won 2&ndash;1, despite the fact that the ball often stuck in the mud. Boyd scored with a 30 yard shot after 29 minutes, Dailey after 55 mins., and Harrison for Hull a minute later. Blues&rsquo; record &mdash; P.35; W.17; L,11; D.7; For 55; Ag.47; Pts 41; Posn.3rd. They play Cardiff C. (2nd) on Monday.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I took Ginger out before breakfast and then went for a ride down the village on my bicycle.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I then stayed in all morning until Dad and I took Ginger for a run in the park at about 4.15pm. As usual it was raining once more.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I took Hound out.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We got up at about nine o&rsquo;clock this morning. Before breakfast I went down the village with Ginger to get a newspaper.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Uncle Bill and Aunt Doll from Kidderminster arrived at about eleven. We listened to the Boat Race at 2.15. Cambridge won by about 12 lengths in 20 minutes 50 seconds.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On Saturday it was called no race when Oxford sank in less than three minutes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After listening to the Race we went for a short walk. It was raining again.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Aunt and Uncle had to go at 7.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We got up rather late this morning. I spent most of the day out of doors playing football. I also took Hound out three or four times.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As there was no Cub meeting tonight I stayed in and listened to the radio.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad&rsquo;s holiday came to an end today. I got up at 8.30. After breakfast I washed up and then took Ginger for a walk down the village.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I then played out until dinner time. After dinner we all went for a long walk, and, of course, Ginger came with us. We walked to Olton, then along St. Bernard&rsquo;s Road, Prospect Lane and Danford Lane. I saw quite a few birds including four Robins.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We came back along Streetsbrook Road and back down Shirley Road, arriving at 4.15 just in time to listen to &ldquo;Mrs. Dale&rsquo;s Diary&rdquo;. After tea I played out until after it was dark.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been very cold today but dry anyway.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After going down the village with Ginger today we all went to town at 11.30.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At Lewis&rsquo;s we saw a very extensive Gauge &ldquo;O&rdquo; Model Railway. I should think the whole layout would more than cover the length of our dining room and it would cost easily &pound;350.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was disgusted to see a Raven encaged in Pets&rsquo; Corner. Many shops too, are selling tortoises when they should be asleep during this bitterly cold winter.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;While in town I bought a copy of the <I>Sport Argus Cricket Annual 1951</I>. As usual it is a very good shillingsworth with all last season&rsquo;s results, fixtures, and pen pictures of Warwickshire and Worcestershire players.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I had a postcard from Stephen Chadwin on holiday at Penzance this morning. He only put one 1d stamp on instead of two, so it is franked &ldquo;2d to pay liable to postcard rate&rdquo;, but why haven&rsquo;t they stuck a proper &ldquo;To Pay&rdquo; 2d stamp on it? It reads:&mdash;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went down the village to get a bale of straw for Ginger&rsquo;s bed. When I got back I burnt the old straw on the rubbish heap.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner a friend of Mam&rsquo;s came. I obtained some turf from the road and so managed to returf a small area of lawn by the shed. At present the heavy rains have left the lawn in a pitiful state though it did not rain much today and we&rsquo;ve had some sunshine. weather</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I listened to &ldquo;Any Questions?&rdquo; and later took Ginger to meet Mam and Dad coming out of the Olton.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I washed up and then listened to the Dick Barton Omnibus. Dick Barton has now finished for good. I remember quite well listening to the programme when it first began in October 1946.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner we listened to the Lincolnshire Handicap won by Barnes Park (33&ndash;1) ridden by J. Sime. Newton Heath was second and Streatley third. Blues beat Doncaster Rovers away 1&ndash;nil. The top of Division II is:&mdash;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went round to Dorling&rsquo;s and got my B.O.P. [<I>Boy&rsquo;s Own Paper</I>] for April.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon we went to the Mission. Mr. Hughes was the speaker and he spoke for quite three quarters of an hour. He was extremely interesting though.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I read over half of my library book <I>Sad Cypress</I> by Agatha Christie and then took Ginger for her walk. I went to bed at 10.15pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I finished reading <I>Sad Cypress</I> this morning.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I played out all day with Brian [Holliday], Wilf [Rogers], Audrey and John. We played football. It kept fine more or less though we had two very heavy showers.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening David and Marjorie came at 8 o&rsquo;clock. At 8.30 I took Ginger for her evening walk and went to meet Mam on her way home from the doctor&rsquo;s [Dr. Gough, 633 Shirley Road] with Clarice.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Later we listened to &ldquo;Variety Fanfare&rdquo; with Al Read as the resident comedian.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I decided to go for a cycle ride to Shirley. I found a wood on my Ordnance Survey Map and it turned out to be in Bills Lane, Shirley. I remembered that John Wilkins [a friend at K.E.S.] lives at 117 and I did, in actual fact, meet him. I saw a Marsh Tit in the wood. It had not the white nape of the Coal tit.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I continued cycling and found an old mill where I saw a pair Jackdaws in one of the tiny windows. I saw at least three rookeries. The rooks are extremely busy even though there are no leaves on the trees yet. I like to watch them flying to and from their nests and cawing noisily.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got home by 2.15. After dinner I played outside for some time and went to Cubs tonight. I was the only one there until Mr. Harvey came just after 7.30.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a terrible accident at Lewis&rsquo;s yesterday afternoon. A lad was sliding on his stomach down the banisters between the fourth and fifth floors, when he lost his balance and plunged 80 feet to his death. He was John Molloy (10) of 6 Dixon Road, Small Heath.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I wrote a couple of letters, including one to Bob. I played out from 5.30 until 7.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I had a bath and listened to Frank Vosper&rsquo;s play <I>Murder on the Second Floor</I> in &ldquo;Curtain Up&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning Mam took us to Kidderminster. It was the first time I had been there since I was seven years old. Our 8.49 &rsquo;bus from Navigation Street arrived at exactly 9.50. We met Aunt Doll and Dorothy, or rather they met us, and then we did some shopping together before catching the Sutton Farm &rsquo;bus [to Woodward Road, where they live at No 36]. We called first at Aunt Ruth&rsquo;s.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner we watched the Television. From 3.0 until 3.30, we saw some Spring Fashions, then &ldquo;Bygones&rdquo; for the next thirty minutes. In &ldquo;For the Children&rdquo;, we saw &ldquo;Men of Action&rdquo; &mdash; the Engine Driver. I was not at all impressed by any of the three programmes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Before going home at 8.0pm we went to see Uncle Bill for a few minutes. We caught the 8.50 &rsquo;bus &amp; got home at 10.15. I then took Hound out for a short walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I cycled to Grandad&rsquo;s [23 Pretoria Road, Bordesley Green] &amp; went on to the match &mdash; Blues v Sheffield United. B&rsquo;ham C: Merrick; Green, Badham; Dorman, Atkins, Ferris; Berry, Higgins, Trigg, Rowley, Warhurst.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Rowley scored in the 19th minute, Higgins after 30 minutes and Warhurst got his first goal for Blues six minutes later. There was no further scoring.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nickel Coin (40&ndash;1) won [the Grand National] by six lengths from Royal Tan (22&ndash;10. Only TWO of a field of thirty-six finished. Derrinstown (66&ndash;1) was re-mounted and came third, a quarter mile behind! Eleven horses fell at the first fence and there were only five horses left at half-way.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to the Piccadilly to see James Stewart in <I>Harvey</I> about a man who tags along with an imaginary white rabbit. A very good film on the whole though a bit too &ldquo;wordy&rdquo; occasionally.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened at all today. We got up rather late.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I read this week&rsquo;s <I>The Scout</I> [given me each week by Mr. Harvey]. Then at 4.30 Dad and I took Ginger for a run in the park. We saw three Mallard circling round.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today is Census day and I have just finished filling in our form for Dad. The last census was way back in 1931. It will be interesting to learn the present population figures.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Birmingham&rsquo;s population:&mdash; 1901 ... 533,040; 1931 ... 1,002,603.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I took Hound out &amp; heard a Tawny Owl hooting for about twenty minutes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We all stayed in bed until 10.45 this morning. It was warmer there, we have no coal and it is raining outside.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At about 2.30 we all went to Aunt Greta&rsquo;s flat. I forgot to mention that Aunt Greta visited us last Tuesday afternoon. We got back home by 5.45pm. Greta very kindly gave us a bag of coal so we lit a fire when we got back. It burnt beautifully. Our coal refuses to burn brightly or give out any heat, in fact it closely ressembles [<I>sic</I>] a lump of slate.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I took Ginger for her evening walk and while I was out I saw part of a T.V. film &ldquo;A hundred years of medicine&rdquo; at Cuttriss&rsquo;s [Warwick Road]. I did not hear or see the Owl.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I stayed in bed for some time this morning and then when I got up I went round to Dorling&rsquo;s to get last week&rsquo;s <I>The Listener</I> and today&rsquo;s <I>Picture Show</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I took Ginger for a walk along the [Grand Union] canal from Yardley Road to Lincoln Road. It was a bright afternoon and there were hundreds of birds. I saw Crows, Rooks, Greenfinch, Chaffinches, two pairs of Bullfinches, a Great Tit, Blue Tit and Coal Tits, a Robin, a Wren and a Mute Swan, not to mention Starlings, Sparrows, Thrushes and Blackbirds. I also saw a Kingfisher fly straight across the canal and disappear between two bushes. All I saw was a vivid blue streak.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to Cubs. They collected &pound;1 l5s 11d for Bob-a-Job [Week]. I took Ginger out when I got back.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning Mam and I cleared most of the furniture and all of the carpets etc. out of the dining room as we were having the chimney swept this afternoon. I also went down the village with Ginger.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I washed up and then at 2.15 Ginger and I went along the canal from Woodcock Lane. The canal is always an interesting walk in the Spring especially when the bushes and trees are breaking into leaf. I saw several nests and apart from yesterday&rsquo;s birds, a Jay, Sparrow Hawk and Magpies.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We walked past the Solihull Gas Works. Here the smell was terrible and some filthy looking water poured from pipes into the canal. No wonder that dead fish float on the canal at Hatton!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I again heard the Owl tonight.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;All yesterday and part of today we have lived in the Sitting Room. Today we moved the table back into the Dining Room, the Radio too. I stayed in most of the morning and wrote three letters one to Bob [Vitoria], another to Stephen [Chadwin] and a card to &ldquo;Winnie&rdquo; [John Winrow]. Then I washed up.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went shopping down the village with Mam. It rained hard. Ginger came with me.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing else happened all day. In the evening I took Ginger for her evening walk. It was still raining. When I got home I had a bath and went to bed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had another talk &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Look at the Pond&rdquo; rejected by the B.B.C. this morning &mdash; that&rsquo;s three in succession now.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was up at eight o&rsquo;clock this morning. After breakfast I washed up and then did some writing. After this I went down to the Post Office with Ginger.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I stayed in reading until 3.30. Then I took Ginger out. I got some fire-wood from off the field &mdash; part of an old oak by the [31A] &rsquo;bus stop had been cut down.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I played out for half an hour and washed up. It is now eight o&rsquo;clock and Mam and Dad are at the cinema as usual. They have gone to the Warwick to see a musical, <I>The Daughter of Rosie O&rsquo;Grady</I> (U), with June Haver and Gordon Macrea, and <I>On Secret Service</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today I broadcast for the fourth time in &ldquo;Midland Magazine&rdquo; No. 36. I arrived at 11.30am to rehearse the play &ldquo;Queen Guinevere &mdash; her Jeste&rdquo; by Marcus Bennet, who played Sir Lancelot. The others taking part were Pamela Watkinson, John Bonsor, Maurice Oakley and Peter Towers. This rehearsal lasted until 12.30. From 1.30 until 2.15 we went through the whole programme then we &ldquo;messed around&rdquo; for quite some time while each person read his piece over the mike [and signed autographs.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Those in today&rsquo;s programme were Sonia Beeseley (narrator), Marcus Bennett, John Bennett, Pamela Watkinson, John M. Davies, Jennifer Langdale, Michael Grayson, Anthony N. Aspin, Margaret Stephens, John Eames Bonsor, Brigid Walsh, Maurice Oakley, Elsa Till, Peter L. Towers, Julie Farnsworth, Pauline Layton, Christine Reynolds, Janet Yorke, Roma Simpson, Elizabeth Caroline Simpson, Sybil Skelding and Mary Webster who was the only one who didn&rsquo;t sign my autograph book. There were 23 of us altogether. I know Mary and Brigid from previous broadcasts, and Michael too of course].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 3.45 we had tea then at 5.0 we went on the air. We were off the air within six minutes &mdash; a break in transmission which lasted for a minute or so. Altogether the whole programme went off very well. After &ldquo;Mid. Mag.&rdquo; Alec Allen sang several songs to round off the programme. Mam, Clarice &amp; Julia listened in, Dad was gardening. I got home by 5.45pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We put the clocks forward an hour last night so we had an hour&rsquo;s less sleep. I got up at 8.30am and made a pot of tea for Mam and Dad.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I stayed in for most of the morning and after dinner at 2.30 we heard the first instalment of a new serial play &mdash; &ldquo;The Other Side of the Sun&rdquo; which promises to be very interesting. It is about another planet, exactly similar to the earth, which is always hidden from view because it is always on the other side of the sun.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 4.0pm, Dad and I took Ginger to the park for a run.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I played outside until 8.15 and then I took Ginger for her evening walk. I walked right round the village in seventeen minutes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam and I decided to go to town today. The weather was too depressing to stay at home for long. There is nothing much to record.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner Mam and I were going to walk down to Stratford Road taking Ginger with us, but we called in at Snell&rsquo;s on Olton Boulevard East to get me a straw basher and it was too late to walk down and we caught the &rsquo;bus [instead]. I thought that maybe John Winrow would call this afternoon &amp; it was rather a coincidence that we should get on the same &rsquo;bus as he. He had just called for me and found me out.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I put the gravel into the aquarium, planted weeds etc., and filled it with water and left it to stand overnight.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Later I took Hound round the village for her evening walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Having allowed the aquarium to settle down, I put my four Goldfish into the aquarium. They now look most enchanting. I have often dreamt of a nice aquarium, ever since I can remember, in fact.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Later this morning I went shopping with Mam. Ginger came.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner, I took Ginger to the park and I got a dozen snails for the aquarium including three large Planorbis snails.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I got to Cubs early and we got a game of football. Mr. Winters and Mr. Thornborough joined in when they arrived. For the remaining forty minutes, the cubs worked in sixes. I collected the Scouts&rsquo; subs at the club room after cubs.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was home by 9.30 and took Ginger out. A little bee told me it&rsquo;s going to be fine for some days yet!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much else happened all day. This evening after taking Ginger out I heard two Tawny Owls. I set off up Victoria Road to find one but when it hooted found it was sitting on the branch of an oak tree right over my head. It was quite clearly silhouetted against the sky but it flew off almost immediately.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I nearly forgot to mention that Mam and I went to Aunt Daisy&rsquo;s [at 136 Mapleton Road, Hall Green] this afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;John and I got to Rednal today with Ginger by 11.30 and we set off for Upper Bittell. On the way we saw six or seven Swallows &mdash; almost the first to be seen this year &mdash; but no Swifts. Upper Bittell [reservoir] was very turbulent in the strong wind and there were no duck. On Lower Bittell there were Tufted Duck and Mallard. We saw twenty two different birds including a Common Scoter. It was a diving duck, all black &amp; appeared about the same size as the Tufted with which it was swimming. I was observing it through binoculars from 100 yards.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;John and I went up the Lickey Hills for two hours before returning home. I came back through town.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I spent a couple of hours at the park with Ginger. It was a beautiful day and warm too. I rather think it will keep fine for four or five days at Least. I got a water beetle for the aquarium and I also saw almost a dozen Sticklebacks.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Later I played out for some time. Mam and Dad went to the cinema tonight and I went to meet them on their way home at 10.30pm, taking Ginger with me.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I cycled to get some horse-meat this morning.but the Stratford Road shops had none so I had to go to Stoney Lane [Sparkbrook]. There was a big queue because many people are buying horse-meat for their own dinner. It used to cost 8d per pound. It now costs anything from 1s 6d. On my way home I saw four expresses at Tyseley.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I cycled to Blues&rsquo; match v Leeds United after dinner. It was a very disappointing game though. Blues never mastered a light ball and Leeds scored after 24 minutes through Stevenson to win the match.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 5pm I cycled to Blues&rsquo; last home match v Brentford who were captained by Jack Goodwin. [He had played for Birmingham City earlier in his career]. The &ldquo;Bees&rdquo; scored first and in the second half Smith scored for Blues. Result 1&ndash;1.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. we are now to be trained as potential NCO&rsquo;s. This morning Capt. Cooke talked to us about the 36 Grenade.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town and bought a copy of the Festival of Britain Programme for Birmingham and a Guide to Birmingham. I called at Thos Cook&rsquo;s to get a couple of French leaflets.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent all the afternoon doing prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I took Ginger out for her evening walk as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went in my new basher this morning. In Biology we are studying plants. School finished at 11.45am as the Athletic sports, postponed from last term, were being held at 2.15pm and no school dinner was available for competitors.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Cup Final took place this afternoon and I went to Stephen [Chadwin]&rsquo;s to watch the second half on Television. At half-time the score was 0&ndash;0. Then in 50 minutes, with half of Blackpool&rsquo;s defenders appealing for off-side, Milburn ran through to score easily. Five minutes later a back-heel from Taylor found Milburn who shot first time to score a great goal. It was then all over with Blackpool &amp; apart from the goals it was a poor match. Blackpool&rsquo;s forwards never got going. After the game, the King presented the Cup to Joe Harvey, capt of Newcastle United. The Queen presented the medals.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning Uncle Arthur came to do a spot of renovation of the ceiling paper in Mam and Dad&rsquo;s room.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent all the morning doing Physics homework and after dinner I completed a map of Italy and several pages of notes for Geography prep. Bob came to tea at about 4.30. I had just finished re-turfing a small area of the lawn.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the evening I finished some homework, took Hound out and listened to &ldquo;Variety Bandbox&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There was the usual School Choir Practice at 12.30pm, otherwise nothing happened.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not come home on the S.B. as I had to call at the <I>Mail</I> offices to get some weather readings.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I read more of my Peter Cheyney novel <I>Try Anything Twice</I> on the way home.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent the evening writing an English essay on Soccer. It took me two hours altogether.</P>

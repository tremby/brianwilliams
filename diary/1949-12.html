<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The two teams lined up while the band played the Swedish National Anthem &amp; <I>God Save the King</I>. B&rsquo;ham, scored first from a Jordan free-kick then inside-right Almqvist scored two good goals for A.I.K. In the second-half Stewart scored. Final score: 2&ndash;2. A.I.K were the better team slightly, being extremely clever with their ground passing which was a delight to watch. The visiting forwards were leading B&rsquo;ham a lively dance. A.I.K. were very fast but inclined to be flashy &mdash; they often attempted to back-heel the ball. Incidentally the teams were:&mdash;</P>

It was only B&rsquo;ham&rsquo;s 2nd victory and the first since August 24th. Their record is: P19, W2, L12, Dr5, For 13, Ag 34, Points 9.

I had three books including Wilfred Pickles <I>Between You and Me</I> [autographed by him and Mabel]. The other two were <I>Sub-Chaser</I> by Josef Berger and <I>Children of the New Forest</I> by Captain Marryat. The latter was sent to me from Freda.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My other presents were a 1950 Letts Diary [like this one], a chess set, and an autograph book from Bob. I also had a pair of socks, a box of Chocolates and some fruit &amp; nuts.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a beautiful morning when I got up at about 10.30. After breakfast I read &amp; went to the park with Dad to give the dogs a run.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;For dinner we had Chicken and peas.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I listened to the Radio. There are many special programmes. We listened to H.M. the King at 3.0pm. of course. At 4.15 I heard an adaptation of <I>A Christmas Carol</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;For tea we had mince-pies and trifle as well as Christmas cake.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I listened to a Christmas Party with many radio personalities taking part.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is 9.30 now and so ends Christmas Day 1949. We have at least had a pleasant Christmas if only a quiet one. Apart from the usual crackers and paper hats, fruit and nuts, we had a coconut and for the first time I tasted coconut milk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I woke up at about 9.0am this morning. When I got up it was 11.30 and much too late for breakfast so we had dinner instead.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon Dad and I went to the B&rsquo;ham City v Derby County match. Blues team was:&mdash; Merrick; Badham, Green; Boyd, Atkins, Dorman; Stewart, Jordan, Duckhouse, Brennan, Berry. At half-time Blues led by 2&ndash;nil, Boyd, &amp; Brennan having scored from a penalty. The games was thrown away within the first ten minutes of the second half when Derby scored the equalising goals. Result 2&ndash;2.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I listened to the last of the present series of &ldquo;P.C.49&rdquo; and &ldquo;Panto-mania&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up at about 10 o&rsquo;clock today and made the fire. Mam and Dad got up at 11.30. Like yesterday we had no breakfast but had an early dinner instead.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner Dad and I took Ginger for a run in the park. Tess ate a bone yesterday and is not at all well today, so we left her in the shed. Grandad came while we were at the park. When we got home I played a game of chess as best as I was able.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Dad took us to the Olton where we saw Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire in <I>Holiday Inn</I>. There was also a supporting film of the Aquashow at Blackpool with Johnny Weismuller.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Before breakfast this morning I cycled down the village to the Post Office. After breakfast I made a telephone call and then read a comic &amp; played Draughts.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I washed up. This evening I listened to the radio.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast today I washed up and then did some shopping for Mam, and made a telephone call to Mrs. Moore. Then I cycled to Tyseley and saw the Midday Expresses. Many &ldquo;Kings&rdquo; are appearing with blue liveries, while several 5100 class tanks have received the B.R. emblem of the &ldquo;lion and wheel&rdquo;. locomotives</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Harris came just before dinner and stayed until 4.45. I washed up again and then read the <I>Rover</I>. I also made a list of my cigarette cards [writing them down in pencil on pages 50&ndash;52 of my Challenge Duplicate Book. Altogether there are 1159 cards from 62 sets, including three of the five albums given me by Fred Oxley in April; I seem to have missed the other two.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have also been collecting Turf cigarette cards. Due to the paper shortage few cards have been printed since the War started, but Cavander&rsquo;s have solved the problem by printing two cards on the back of the tray in each cigarette packet. So I have been picking them up in the street and cutting them out. So far I have got:&mdash; &ldquo;Footballers&rdquo;, 25/50, and &ldquo;Olympics 1948&rdquo;, 13/50, both issued last year, and &ldquo;Sports Series&rdquo;, 17/50, and &ldquo;Famous Film Stars&rdquo;, 8/50, which have started coming out this year.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I washed up and then as Mam had to go to Hospital I took Clarice and Julia to see a Marionette show at Lewis&rsquo;s. We missed part of the 2 o&rsquo;clock performance of &ldquo;Hansel and Gretel&rdquo; so we saw it complete at 3.0pm. We got home just after 4 o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Mam and Dad went to the pictures so I did one or two things I wanted to do. It is 8.30 now and I shall go to bed soon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I received a letter from the B.B.C. I shall probably be broadcasting again in &ldquo;Midland Magazine&rdquo; in February next. I hope so.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Last day of the half-century. This morning I took Tess for a walk down the village. Dad took Ginger to Warwick where she ran 3rd in the 3rd race.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went to the Ian Allan Locospotters Club Rally at the Midland Institute. It was the first one held in Birmingham. Among the well-known personalities there was Mr. O.S. Nock who gave a talk illustrated by lantern slides, Mr. O.J. Morris and Mr. Baldwin &mdash; chairman in the absence of Ian Allan who is ill. There was another talk by Mr. R.H. Briggs of the Midland Red, a quiz, and two films as well as tea. A most enjoyable Rally.</P>

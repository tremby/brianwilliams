<H2>Death of Granma</H2>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dear Granma died today and we can hardly bear it. A man came to our house to take photographs of us this morning. He took one of all five of us on the settee, with me sitting on the arm near the hearth, and then one of Clarice, Julia and me on the settee. [jpg]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner Dad took me to see Granma. She wasn&rsquo;t very well yesterday and when we got there today she was still in bed in the front room. I went to see her and she said, &ldquo;Go and cut yourself a bit of cake, son,&rdquo; but I didn&rsquo;t feel like any with her being so ill. Then Dad sent me to Blake Lane running up the hill to ask for Dr. Lloyd to come. The lady said yes, but when I got back and he didn&rsquo;t come Dad asked me to go back and say it was urgent. Then when I got back I had to go yet again. This time when I got back I went into the front room and the clothes had been pulled over the back of the bed and Granma was just lying there. Dad was crying and I knew she must be dead. Also I saw her glass eye lying on a table by the bed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad sent me out of the room to wait for him and said he wouldn&rsquo;t be long. Eventually we left Grandad and Fred there, we walked up Pretoria Road and Third Avenue and waited for the &rsquo;bus. On the &rsquo;bus I could see Dad was crying and to take his mind off it I asked him something about the Blues. We got off at the Yew Tree and waited for the Outer Circle &rsquo;bus, and then walked home from the village as usual. When we got home I went in first through the back door into the kitchen and then opened the door into the living room, and Mammy said, &ldquo;Is your Granma all right?&rdquo; and I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, but Dad said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; and we all cried.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was Granma&rsquo;s funeral today. I had the day off school and we all went to Granma and Grandad&rsquo;s. The house was full of people I have never seen before. The funeral was at Yardley Cemetery at 11.20am. I wanted to go but Mam and Dad wouldn&rsquo;t let me as I had to look after Clarice and Julia. I have never been to a funeral. When they got back we all had tripe and onions but I didn&rsquo;t like it very much. Mammy always says &ldquo;it&rsquo;s tripe&rdquo; when she doesn&rsquo;t like anything.</P>

<H2>A small fortune unclaimed</H2>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;A very strange thing has happened. Uncle Elijah&rsquo;s son Percy, Granma&rsquo;s nephew, who came to the funeral yesterday, received a letter the day before she died to say that there is &ldquo;a sum of unclaimed money amounting to Several Hundred Pounds which we consider can be recovered by the descendants of the late William Bower&rdquo; who was Granma&rsquo;s father. So Granma was due to receive some money but has died before she even knew about it.</P>

<P><table><tr><td width=5% bgcolor="#ff99ff"> &nbsp; </td><td>
The letter was from Pallot &amp; Co., 2 New Court, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, London WC2, and dated 22nd November 1946. It says that Uncle Percy, Aunt Ada and Aunt Mabel (Granma&rsquo;s brother and sisters), and Frederick Bower (her nephew) &ldquo;have already approved our terms and signed our agreement.&rdquo; Unfortunately, Granma was one of about 23 children of William Bower &mdash; he died on Sunday 14th August 1910 without making a will.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I got up at ten o&rsquo;clock and then went shopping as usual after breakfast.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I did some homework and then took Ginger for a walk to the park.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I went to the Library and got a bird book and a book for Dad as well. Then I called for Alan [Hiley] but he was out, so I took Hound for her evening walk as far as Tyseley bridge. On the way I saw a wild swan flying S.E.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I again went shopping this morning then I took Ginger for a walk. We went down York Road and she pulled me into the race-course, making quite a fuss when she couldn&rsquo;t go in.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been watching the Thrush&rsquo;s nest continually. The hen bird is still sitting but I haven&rsquo;t seen its mate for several days. Either the birds are nesting late or this is a second brood; the latter is unusual for Mistle-Thrushes though.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went to the Library again.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to Cubs. We did work after a few minutes of football. I stayed to do some P.T. with the Scouts for a while afterwards.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner we cycled into Solihull and walked in the field where Bob and I went last Sunday week.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to Scouts and passed my Tenderfoot badge.</P>

<P>P.S. Heard the cuckoo most of the afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Back to School, work and cricket, prep. and wickets. Well prep. anyway. As usual we went to form rooms for first period. Mr. Whalley, who has been in hospital, is back again.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. those of us who have stayed to enjoy the hospitality of the Army and Basic Sections cleaned rifles then did rifle drill.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I played cricket in the House practice at Eastern Road. I scored four not out and bowled one maiden over. Kipper scored fourteen (n.o.). We came home together on the 1A.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I have done Geometry prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I cut some of the &ldquo;lawn&rdquo; then did some prep. for an hour. Mam and Dad have gone to the cinema, of course [to see <I>Old Mother Riley&rsquo;s New Venture</I> (U) and <I>Jungle Man</I> (U) at the Warwick].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As we have done most of this year&rsquo;s Chemistry but have rather too much Physics [still to do] we are going to have an extra period of the latter and one less of Chemistry. [Mr. Gess our form master takes us for both].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I missed the S.B. this morning unfortunately but I was not late. After prayers I went down to the Headmaster&rsquo;s study but the Head was absent. I worked with Winny in Physics and I came home via town with Winny and Hop. [Trevor Hopkins].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I was in charge of the six and one reserve who took part in the District Championship. Mr. Winters was there and I helped him as an adjudicator. St. Gregory&rsquo;s won with 79&frac12; out of 83 and we were second with 68&frac12;. The competition took place at St. Gregory&rsquo;s Hall, Coventry Road.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the S.B.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I did prep. including some in advance so that I shall only have Maths to do tomorrow. (I am down to play for the House 2nd XV).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The School XV opened their season on Saturday with a match against the Staff. They were all out for 65 and the Staff had an easy ten wicket victory by getting 68 for no wicket.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Third period was Physics instead of [the usual] Chemistry. In Maths we are doing Geometry.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our 2nd XI match v Burgess&rsquo;s was cancelled owing to heavy rain this morning. The weather cleared up in the afternoon however.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been hot today, so hot that I decided to eat my lunch outdoors instead of in Room 57. I can&rsquo;t really see that it matters where we eat our sandwiches.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After prayers I paid a visit to the Headmaster [Mr. Howarth] to get permission to leave school at 3.30pm on Friday as I have another B.B.C. audition.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I played football at dinner time. In the afternoon we did a pr&eacute;cis in English.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school the form team played V.S. at Eastern Road. We hired Wheatley &amp; Bayley from V.B. Batting first we scored 63 for 6 dec. (I did not bat) then five V.S. wickets fell quickly. We won in the last over, their last wicket falling at 6.30 for a total [space left].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning after drill we were shown how to use Light Machine Guns (Brens).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went [to the County Ground, Edgbaston] to see the School play Warwicks. Club and Ground. The latter batted first &amp; scored 177 for 5 dec. (Christiansen 52 n.o., Bannister 38). School lost 3 wkts. for 18 but Homer &amp; Revill got together, Homer getting 51. The match ended in a draw at seven o&rsquo;clock with School 116 for 4 (Revill 34 n.o.). A good game!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time I went into the field adjoining the school. It was hot out, and in the past two days the trees have blossomed forth into full leaf. I noticed a couple of Starlings&rsquo; holes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had a History test this afternoon,.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I left school at 3.30 &amp; arrived at the B.B.C. Studios in Broad Street at 4.0 exactly for an audition. I shall be reading a short story in &ldquo;Mid. Mag&rdquo; on June 10th (D.V.).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to look at the nest again. The bird was still sitting but there was only the one bird there; actually, I haven&rsquo;t seen the pair together since I discovered the nest on April 18th, though I haven&rsquo;t kept watch for more than ten minutes at a time. The eggs have probably, in fact should have hatched by now.</P>

The lawn, newly re-turfed, doesn&rsquo;t look so bad now, and the part we seeded three weeks ago is growing well. All the beds are set out now: Dad did the front bed this afternoon. Dad also crazy-paved the path.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I played cricket on the field [the strip of land between Victoria Road and Olton Boulevard East] and then did homework.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today [Bank Holiday], Aunt Doll, Uncle Bill, Dorothy and Cyril [from Kidderminster] came to visit us. It was the first time I had seen them since 1946. What a lot of things have happened since then! They arrived at about 11.30 and we had dinner at twelve.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the afternoon I spent over an hour writing Physics and History notes. Later we all went for a walk through the [Fox Hollies] park.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I helped with the washing up and then we played some gramophone records before our guests left at eight o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I took Ginger for a walk as far as Tyseley and back.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I cycled to Bromford Bridge where Birmingham Races were being held. It was a typical racing scene:&mdash; thousands of people and hundreds of cars, buses &amp; coaches. I actually saw the last two races from a piece of waste land that overlooked the course &amp; I could see the winning post easily. I had my binoculars with me [Grandad&rsquo;s actually].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I played cricket in the street with the boys until nine. It has been a beautiful day &amp; the sun has shone continually.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At school today nothing happened apart from a Physics test.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time playing in the playground I scored 0, 0 and 0 but took six wickets with twelve balls (including hat trick). I also spent a few minutes at House nets.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At Bradford there was a Test Trial. The Rest were all out for 27. Laker took 8 wickets for 2 runs &mdash; probably the best bowling ever in first class cricket. England scored 229 (Hollies st. Spooner b Berry 4). [Eric Hollies and Dick Spooner both play for Warwickshire].</P>

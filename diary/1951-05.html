<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happened this morning. This afternoon we opened our cricket season with matches v Burgess&rsquo;s. There are four elevens this year. I was picked for the 2nd XI.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We batted first and scored 110 for 9 declared. I was to have gone in No. 4 but my tree was troubling me again so I elected to go in last and I didn&rsquo;t have to bat. Nightingale got 36 n.o. and Griffin 28.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Burgess&rsquo;s scored 111 for 5 and so won by 5 wickets. This was mainly due to a fine innings by Maxie Wilkins who scored 48. I fielded at deep fine leg and didn&rsquo;t have to do too much running. I got home for 7.0pm</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I have been doing prep. I got home too late of course to go to Cubs.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Geography we are now discussing the Population of Italy. Nothing much happened in Chemistry or Physics. In Biology Mr. Monkcom took us into Edgbaston Park. Chadwin and I went all round the lake to see if we could see some frog-spawn but there was none at all. We saw a pair of Sedge Warblers but little else. The sun was shining when we went into the Park. After fifteen minutes it was pouring.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the dinner hour I did some homework in our form room. I came home on the Special Bus.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I blancoed my belt and gaiters and polished brasses.</P>

<h3>THURSDAY 3rd MAY

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The great Festival of Britain has opened! The King, in a broadcast to the world from the steps of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral this morning, officially declared the festival open. The King with the Queen, Princess Elizabeth, The Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Margaret had driven through beflagged, flower bedecked streets lined with cheering crowds, to attend an inter-denominational service. There was a colourful procession, announced by heralds, into the Cathedral where the vast congregation included Cabinet ministers, political leaders, foreign diplomats, civic dignitaries and representatives of the Services.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;To celebrate the festival, special postage stamps have been issued &mdash; a 2&frac12;d red stamp and a 4d blue with the Festival emblem which I have reproduced here. In addition four others stamps have changed their colours but have kept the same design. The &frac12;d issue is now orange, the 1d stamp blue, the 1&frac12;d green and the 2d brown.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home from school through town and bought the 2&frac12;d and 4d stamps together with a packet of special envelopes. I could not get a first-day cover in town because the Post Office refused to date-stamp my envelope. However the Acocks Green P.O. were willing to stamp it for me &mdash; on condition that I registered it. This I did and I am expecting it back tomorrow morning.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I bought the other new stamps I took them straight to Shirley Road P.O. and got them stamped with no trouble at all.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening the City Transport Illuminated Bus went on its first outing. It visited Acocks Green at 9.22pm so we went down the village to see it. There were thousands of people lining its route. There was a great buzz of excitement [unintentional pun!] as the &rsquo;bus appeared at the top of Westley Road. It looked really fine. The words &ldquo;Festival of Britain&rdquo; flashed on and off but no one really had much chance to see the &rsquo;bus properly &mdash; it went too fast.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent the lunch hour reading in the form room. In French, Mr. Leeds read us a story and we then answered questions about the story, in French of course.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I caught the Special &rsquo;Bus home. Tonight I have been doing homework and I also listened to &ldquo;Any Questions?&rdquo; as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We rather pulled Mr. Guy&rsquo;s leg today. Some of us were hiding when he came in and when I told him that 2 boys hadn&rsquo;t appeared he said that unless they came out of hiding at once we would have to stay in. He realised a little too late that the two were absent.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I cycled to the School Ground to see the 1st XI play the Staff. The Staff batted first and scored 119 for 6 declared. (J.B. Guy 26, R.D.J. Robertson 22 n.o., A.J. Trott 18). School were left with just 2 hours to obtain the necessary runs but Benson got a duck when only three runs had been scored. 32 runs were put on for 3rd wicket then 4 wickets fell for only 10 runs. School were playing for a draw but were all out for 71 with five minutes to go. (Gough 23, Revill 16; Guy 2 for 7, Robertson 2 for 9, Leeds 2 for 14).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight a special &ldquo;Festival of Variety&rdquo; was broadcast from 7.30 to 8.30 and from 9 to 10pm. It was a very good show, and included Ted Ray, Donald Peers, Max Miller, Frankie Howerd, Robb Wilton, Danny Kaye, Gracie Fields and many others. Wilfred Pickles introduced the programme.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I took Hound out at 8.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We played basketball in the playground in Gym.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 5.15pm I cycled to St. Andrews to see Blues play Airdrieonians. Airdrie were one up in 8 minutes with a goal by McCullough (outside left) &mdash; a terrific right foot volley which left Merrick standing &mdash; the second best goal at St. Andrews this season. At half-time Airdrie were 3 up and fife [<I>sic</I>] minutes after the restart the score was 3&ndash;2. The Airdrie goalie was penalised for taking more than three steps without bouncing the ball &amp; Berry scored. The game ended 5&ndash;3 to Airdrie who got two of Blues&rsquo; goals! It was Dennis Jennings&rsquo; last game for Birmingham.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon, Dad and I cycled to Grandad&rsquo;s and we then went on to St. Andrews to see Blues play Dinamo (Yugoslavia) in a Festival match. The foreigners won the game by 2&ndash;nil and in the second half, completely outplayed Blues. Dinamo hit the post twice, the bar twice and Green kicked off the line. They wore blue shirts and shorts (Blues played in red) and when they came on to the pitch they threw presents to the spectators. After the game they ran to the centre and bowed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At school last Saturday we had no one for Biology and Mr. Mathews for Chemistry. This morning we had Mr. Monkcom for Biology and Chemistry.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I took Ginger to a Dog Show at Jack Mould&rsquo;s Sports Fields, Streetsbrook Road, Hall Green, at 2.0pm. It was opened by Air Commodore J.A. Cecil Wright, Chairman of the Kennel Club. [He is 64, served in the First World War, joined the R.F.C. in 1916 and was Squadron Leader of 605 (County of Warwick) Bomber Squadron 1926&ndash;36. He was M.P. for Erdington from 1936 until 1945. He is going to change his name to Cecil-Wright, hyphenated.] The judge was Tom Scott. I went in the Child Handler&rsquo;s Class and received a bar of chocolate and a shilling but Ginger did not win a prize in the Sporting Class. This did not take place until 5.30 though and we had already been there for three and a half hours. Apart from the various classes in the show there were also sheep dog demonstrations by Mr. John Jones, the International Sheep Dog Trainer who worked five dogs at once.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I caught the 31A &rsquo;bus home from the [Gospel Lane] terminus and got back at 6.0pm. Grandad had come. It was too late to go to the first house at the Hippodrome and though I went very early, I did not get a seat but had to stand most of the time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The show was &ldquo;Randle&rsquo;s Scandals of 1951&rdquo;. After the Overture by the Hippodrome orchestra we saw the entire company on &ldquo;the show-boat River Belle&rdquo;. The third act was Hal Mack and his Dancing Demons who literally [<I>sic</I>] burnt up the stage with their tap-dancing. After this act we saw a comedy scene &ldquo;In the Jungle&rdquo; with Frank Randle, Peter Webster, Arthur Cannon, Gus Aubrey, Raymond Waller, Emil Dale and Stan Stafford. Next came the Phantom Guard presented by the Zio Angels and then before the Intermission were the Three Palmers who performed acrobatic antics.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After the Intermission there was a scene in an old French Courtyard followed by Rayne, a contortionist and some singing by Stan Stafford. Next we saw Frank Randle and the whole of the company in &ldquo;Grandpa&rsquo;s Birthday&rdquo; with Doris Powell as Grandma. After this Frank Randle made a little speech and introduced two of the company to the Audience. In the last scene &mdash; a crofter&rsquo;s cottage in the Highlands &mdash; the Daphnia Girl Pipers led the company into the Audience. It was enjoyable entertainment. I got home for just after 11.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We got up rather late this morning. Nothing much happened.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam, Dad and I went to the Mission after dinner. A visit was paid us by the Sparkhill Male Voice Quartet who brought us an inspiring message with them.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We walked back from Digbeth as far as the Piccadilly and got home for 5.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the evening I completed some homework and took Ginger for her evening walk at 8.30pm. It had rained previously but had stopped by then.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We returned to the subject of climate in Geography today but Mr. Benett also showed one or two of our maps on the epidiascope.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There was the usual Choir Practice at 12.25pm in Big School.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Gym we again played basketball in the playground.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I caught the S.B. home.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I found my name on the School Notice Board. It appears I have to take a French Oral Examination in the G.C.E. examination next Monday morning so my exams start a little earlier than I thought.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did prep throughout the evening and took Ginger out as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s been rather cloudy today but not cold, and it&rsquo;s been dry too. I mowed the lawn and cut the piece in the centre between 5 and 7pm. weather</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual nothing much happened today. I now have the dates of all the internal examinations which last from June 27th to July 6th. Altogether I shall be taking at least sixteen written papers and two others.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town as I wanted to buy a &ldquo;Biroette&rdquo; refill for my pen.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Several alterations have been taking place in the City Centre. The Hill Street Bridge which was closed on 28th February 1949 was re-opened to traffic two months ago but not yet for pedestrians. Meanwhile, half of Navigation Street bridge is being taken up for repair &amp; work is well under way.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did prep most of the afternoon &amp; did not go to Cubs tonight.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning in Geography we started to discuss the reasons why Spain is not now a prosperous country.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time I played football for the first time for almost a fortnight and again scored three goals [but there was a Concert I wish I had gone to, with B.S. Adams playing music for the recorder, and Yetman and Oxley playing duets for trumpet and piano, which I heard was terrific!].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school I went to an Alto Practice and then came home as usual with Kirkby [who lives at 73 Staplehurst Road, Hall Green].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After doing prep I listened to &ldquo;The Petrified Forest&rdquo; in &ldquo;Curtain Up&rdquo; with Bette Davis, Gary Merrill and Emlyn Williams.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Arctic Prince (28&ndash;1) today won the Derby with Sybil&rsquo;s Nephew 2nd (50&ndash;1) and Signal Box 3rd (20&ndash;1). I picked Arctic Prince to win!</P>

<h3>THURSDAY 31st MAY

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;For today&rsquo;s section attack we wore K.D. [khaki drill], Musketry Order and helmets, and we grease-painted our faces. Zero hour was 12.45pm and the attack took two to three minutes. We were issued with Blank ammunition. I think it quite impressed the little boys! It wasn&rsquo;t too bad anyway.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I played for the 2nd XI v Williams&rsquo;. Bottomley won the toss for us &amp; we batted first, scoring 72. I went in No. 7, hit the first ball for a four (very nearly six) just as I promised, &amp; then tried to do the same with the next which removed my bails, having pitched a little shorter. Williams&rsquo; did not take long to hit up 75 for 4 wkts. (Hawkins 20, J.D. Adams 27 n.o.). Our bowlers did the wrong thing by pitching everything on the leg stump just asking to be hit! Fielding was poor.</P>

<H2>Baptised

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mammy and Daddy took me to Church. Mr. Keays held me and put water on my head. I gurgled with joy. <I>Before I formed thee in the womb I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee.</I></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>[The Baptism, at St. Paul&rsquo;s Church, Bordesley Green, was conducted by the Vicar, the Reverend Reginald H.L. Keays. Brian&rsquo;s parents are lodging with Mrs. Sarah Wall, a godly woman who sent Brian a card on the day he was born; she lets her rooms at 82 Finnemore Road. Mr. Keays, who married Brian&rsquo;s parents on 29th September last year, lives seven doors up the road at N&ordm; 68; he calls regularly to see them and the new baby, and always prays for them.]

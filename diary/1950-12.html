<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today&rsquo;s exams were Physics, French and Trigonometry. I did very badly in the French but I should get 50% in the others.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 1.10pm the altos had a special practice in the Music Room.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the Special Bus.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam and Dad went to the cinema as usual. I went to bed at 7.45 and read my <I>Meccano Magazine</I>s and did some Chemistry revision until nine o&rsquo;clock. I moved into my own bedroom on Wednesday evening.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I finished reading <I>Stolen Journey</I> last night. It was a good book in general but tended to be rather boring in some of the earlier chapters.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had our Chemistry examination after break this morning. It wasn&rsquo;t too bad.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town as I wanted to have a look in one or two of the shops. There seemed to be quite a distinct Christmassy atmosphere everywhere. I got home for 2.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We are gradually getting the lounge furnished. We had the two armchairs already. Now we have a carpet &mdash; it came yesterday. This afternoon a settee, which Dad had had newly re-upholstered, arrived, but the front door had to be taken off in order to get it in the house. It was a bit of a struggle even then.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Snow fell during the night and lay over an inch thick this morning. I got up at 9.30, made a pot of tea and lit the fire. Then I put some bread out in the garden &amp; there were soon no less than three dozen birds on the lawn. One starling kept vainly trying to balance on a tall pea-stick.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I stayed in for most of the day reading and revising Geography notes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual nothing much happened at school today. In Scripture we are continuing our comparison of the Gospels. In Maths we are doing Geometry &amp; in English we are reading some of W.W. Jacob&rsquo;s short stories &mdash; and we also read more of <I>The Taming of the Shrew</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town and bought a copy of the <I>B.B.C. Year Book 1951</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I did some Maths and French.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I have been to Cubs as usual and I am going to bed after I have had a bath. I took Ginger for her evening walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I dreamt last night that I missed the Special. I did. It was about 8.49 when I got down the village. It was 9.15 when I got off the tram, but by a piece of great good luck I got into school just on time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Biology Mr. Monkcom dissected a white rat.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I finished off a little French prep and then bought three school Christmas cards. I still had over half an hour left so I went into the field. Chadwin was just coming out of the Park. In the field we saw a Meadow Pipit and a Coal Tit. In the snow were the tracks of a fox, a pheasant and several magpies.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing else happened all day. After school I had an alto practice.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I have blancoed my belt and gaiters.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I again missed the S.B. today though it actually went a few minutes early. [It is timed to leave at 8.42am].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. after Battalion Parade, all members of the Choir were dismissed for a special practice which lasted until 12.55.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went straight home &amp; after dinner cycled back to school to play for the Second XV v Kay&rsquo;s. The snow had disappeared but Brookside pitch [at Eastern Road] was waterlogged so we played on Park Vale pitch. We had only been playing ten minutes when, as I was about to touch down in a breakaway from a line-out, I was stopped by someone grabbing my running vest which tore in half. I had to borrow a shirt &amp; the game was held up for five minutes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We lost 31&ndash;5.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I caught the Special this morning without much ado.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After prayers the Choir spent a period rehearsing for Sunday&rsquo;s service.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time I played football for the first time for weeks &amp; scored three or four goals.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 2.25 the Choir had to go to Edgbaston Church for a practice. I got home after this for ten to five.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Mam &amp; Dad have gone to the cinema.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today was the Choir&rsquo;s half holiday so I stayed in bed until nine o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast I went down the village shopping. When I got back I repaired a picture frame.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I stayed in after dinner and finished a map in my Regional Geography notebook. Then I drew a picture of Mont Blanc while I listened to a commentary on the Arsenal v Blackpool match.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I took Ginger for a walk as far as Tyseley and back.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It rained all this morning so I stayed in. We were very late with breakfast so we did not bother with any dinner.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam &amp; Dad went to a School service of carols and lessons at Edgbaston Church. The lessons were read by Mr. Ballance, the Second Master [Mr. E.V. Smith], the Head [Mr. T.E.B. Howarth], a Boy, a K.E. Scholar, a Foundation Scholar, the School Captain [P.A. Gardner] &amp; Vice-Captain [G.T. Lyall].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Gym was inhabited today by several aspiring, and no doubt perspiring, youths who were partaking in that noble competition generally referred to as the P.T. Handicap Competition. Mr. Benett gave us permission to go and watch if we wished but Chadwin, Durnell, Hollingworth and I did some advanced mapwork. I found the gradient of the River Avon in the Cambrians. It varied from 1 in 13.8 to 1 in 3.3 and then 1 in 308! It was interesting work &amp; we spent the first two periods in this way.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After break I watched the P.T. &amp; played football in the dinner hour.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 2.45 we had a Julian Horner concert given by the Gilbert String Quartet.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went shopping for Mam.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to Cubs as usual this evening. Neither Mr. Winters nor Mr. Thornborough was able to be present so I was in complete charge, as I usually am now, until Mr. Harvey came at 7.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I blancoed my belt, gaiters and pouches, and pressed my tunic and trousers. This evening I also went round to Phil&rsquo;s to rehearse some carols with Ian [Hunt] as well. I stayed until nine o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam and Dad went to town to do some shopping.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to go to see <I>The Duchess of Idaho</I> at the Olton cinema in the evening. It was an American film in Technicolor and a very good one too. It was good all round entertainment. The principle stars were Van Johnson and Esther Williams. The other film was called <I>The Violent Hour</I>, a fairly good film and again in Technicolor.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I came out of the cinema at 10.30 some snow had fallen.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I wrote some more of <I>Smugglers&rsquo; Bay</I>. Looking through last year&rsquo;s diary I see that I started the book on August 21st 1949. Now it really is being [<I>sic</I>] to take shape &mdash; I spent all the evening writing.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My dinner &ldquo;hour&rdquo; was from 12.0 till 12.40. I delivered six telegrams in the afternoon: to Southam Road &mdash; Hall Green, then Stratford Road and Shaftmoor Lane and finally Olton Boulevard East, Hartfield Crescent and Hazelmere Road.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Rain fell last night and cleared away the snow but left the roads in a filthy state. By dinner time both Bob&rsquo;s bicycle and my boots were completely spattered with mud.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I delivered ten telegrams in the morning, all in the Hall Green district. After dinner I had to collect an express parcel from Stockfield [Road Congregational Church] Hall which has been temporarily converted into a sorting office for parcels. After this I delivered another four &lsquo;grams after which I went home at 4.30, half an hour early.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I managed to obtain fifty-five minutes for my dinner hour and this gave me time to buy a few more Christmas cards.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I delivered twenty-six telegrams and one parcel today.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening the &ldquo;Barnardo Octet&rdquo; put in its annual performance &amp; this was our finest ever performance. We had two girls singing for us tonight. Altogether we collected &pound;3, which was just ten shillings better than last year.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I heard the church bells heralding Christmas Day at midnight. They sound very beautiful.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had several presents including a fine Kelton wrist-watch which I have always wanted. I also had <I>My Boyhood in a Parsonage</I> by Thomas W. Lamont [the American philanthropist and banker whose father was a Methodist minister], a Datada Diary 1951, a large jig-saw puzzle from Freda and some fruit and nuts.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the day we listened to the morning service and to H.M. The King at 3.0pm fo|lowed by Wilfred Pickles&rsquo; Christmas Party, and later on to Charlie Chester in &ldquo;keep Smiling&rdquo;. The annual B.B.C. party was broadcast from 7.30 to 8.55pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the morning Dad &amp; I took Ginger for a run in the park, but we spent the rest of the day indoors. It did not snow.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up first this morning, made the tea, and went back to bed again. We got up so late that we had our breakfast for dinner.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandad came at about one o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon Dad and I went to see Birmingham City play Manchester City. Blues won 1&ndash;nil with a goal by Trigg in the last minute. Last year Blues beat Man. City with a last minute goal by Brennan.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today&rsquo;s game was a very good one in spite of the slippery conditions. Trautman, the Manchester goalkeeper [who used to be a German prisoner-of-war] played very well but was lucky when a shot from Berry, which he thought was going over, hit the bar. Birmingham were by far the better team. At present their record is:&mdash; P25, W12, L8, D5, For 40, A g 32, Pts 29, Posn 4th. Coventry are 1st&ndash;-30 pts.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Before breakfast today I went down the village to buy a newspaper. Later in the morning Dad and I took Ginger to Hall Green for a trial but none were held [<I>sic</I>] today so Ginger had a run in the park instead.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I stayed in writing more of my book and then read a book.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea we all [five of us] went to the Olton cinema to see Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire and Joan Caulfield in <I>Blue Skies</I>, a Paramount Technicolor film. It was an enjoyable film. As supporting films there was one about the city of Basle in Switzerland and a &ldquo;Popeye&rdquo; film.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When we got back I took Ginger for her walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been cold today and snow has fallen. There are still plenty of gulls in Acocks Green [perhaps from Olton Reservoir].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was 10.15 when I awoke this morning. After having breakfast Julia and I walked to Hall Green where I had to arrange for a trial for Ginger next week.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After we had been to the race-track we walked along Cateswell Road to Tyseley and back home along Warwick Road. Ginger was with us, of course.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I stayed in all the afternoon and looked through some copies of the <I>Children&rsquo;s Own</I> magazine which I used to write when I was at Hartfield Crescent [Junior School]. Altogether I wrote sixteen editions, as a monthly magazine from March 1946 to March 1947, as a quarterly between Autumn 1947 and Summer 1948.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I read Gunby Hadath&rsquo;s <I>The Fifth Feversham</I>. [&ldquo;The Tough of the Track&rdquo; has started up again in today&rsquo;s <I>Rover</I>, No. 1331. The cover features &ldquo;School Badges worn by <I>Rover</I> readers&rdquo;, but there is a mistake, as Bournville Day Continuation College has been spelt with an &ldquo;e&rdquo;. I think it must be because the boy who sent it in is D. Bourne, 68 Dimsdale Road, Northfield.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I took Clarice and Julia to town. We went to Pets&rsquo; Corner in Lewis&rsquo;s to see some of the tropical fish. It was 1.30 when we got back.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I took down the latest weather readings and bundled up the waste paper. Later in the afternoon I went down the village with Mam to help with the shopping. Ginger came with us.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Mam and Dad have gone to the cinema while I have been reading the January 1951 <I>B.O.P.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened all this morning. I was out for an hour and a half shopping for Mam. I took Hound with me.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner Dad and I went to St. Andrews to see B&rsquo;ham City play Notts County. Blues&rsquo; team was: Merrick; Green, Badham; Boyd, Atkins, Ferris; Stewart, Higgins, Trigg, Smith and Berry. Notts County included Lawton and Broome. Blues scored first through Stewart then Sewell and Crookes scored for Notts Co.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the second half only Trigg of the forwards kept his original position owing to injuries to Badham and Higgins, and Sewell and Crookes scored again making the score 4&ndash;1.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On the radio tonight I listened to a very fine play &ldquo;Libel&rdquo; by Edward Wooll in Saturday Night Theatre.</P>

<P>Dear Diary,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are now only seventy five minutes of 1950 left and in this book alone I should have written something in the region of forty-two thousand words.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today I have stayed in for most of the time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner we listened to &ldquo;Life with the Lyons&rdquo; and the first of a new series of &ldquo;P.C.49&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I have been reading a book and have taken Ginger for her evening walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In London at this moment big crowds are gathering around the Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square ready to welcome the new year.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Here endeth this Diary 1950.</P>

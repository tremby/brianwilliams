<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I received a letter from the London Cigarette Card Co. Ltd. this morning. There is a 3d stamp on the little packet as it weighs more than an ordinary letter. The cards they have sent me are:&mdash;</P>

<P>&bull; Gallaher&rsquo;s <I>Dogs</I> (Sept.1936), 2 of a series of 48 (Nos. 36, 47)</P>

<P>&bull; Forecasta <I>Racing Greyhounds</I> (19 &mdash; ) 3/25</P>

<P>&bull; R.S. Challis &amp; Co. Ltd. <I>Wild Birds at Home</I> (1935) 2/36 (7, 19)</P>

<P>&bull; Abdulla &amp; Co. Ltd. <I>Feathered Friends</I> (1935) 5/25 (4, 5, 12&ndash;14)</P>

<P>&bull; John Player&rsquo;s <I>Aviary and Cage Birds</I> (Aug. 1933) 1/50 (37)</P>

<P>&bull; John Sinclair Ltd. <I>Champion Dogs</I> (1938) 3/54 (45, 51, 54)</P>

<P>&bull; B. Morris &amp; Sons <I>Whipsnade Zoo</I> (1932) 1/25 (16)</P>

<P>&bull; B. Morris &amp; Sons <I>Animals at the Zoo</I> (1924) 2/50 (36, 46)</P>

<P>&bull; CWS <I>British and Foreign Birds</I> (1938) 1/48 (42)</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 25 cards from 13 different sets. I don&rsquo;t much like the 1934 Gallaher&rsquo;s <I>Dogs</I> with the yellow background, and the Forecasta <I>Racing Greyhounds</I> are not cigarette cards at all, but I think I shall try to get the complete set as there may be one of Ginger&rsquo;s ancestors. I love the Abdulla <I>Feathered Friends</I> cards as they have gold borders and exotic colours, and the R.S. Challis cards &ldquo;issued with Baldric cigarettes&rdquo; show birds&rsquo; nests and eggs and are very pleasing.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The <I>Birmingham Mail</I> has published the letter I wrote last week on &ldquo;Schoolboys&rsquo; Pocket Money&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dear Sir
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I agree with your correspondent, Geoff Peters, in rejecting the idea that 2s. is enough pocket money for a teenage schoolboy. When our parents were young one could buy a quarter of a pound of sweets for approximately 2d., two oranges for 1d., ice-cream &frac12;d. and 1d. and it cost 1d. to go to the cinema.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Compare these prices with those of to-day. Sweets cost at least 6d., in fact anything up to one shilling per quarter. A visit to the cinema, with a good seat, is also one shilling; ice cream costs at least 3d.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Supposing a boy receives two shillings a week, he either goes to a football match or cinema. Thus 1s. 3d. is spent, and by the time he has bought his quarter of sweets, he has little left of his two shillings. If he wants to buy any books for his hobbies, he needs at least one shilling more. Yours etc.,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As no one in the road is on the telephone, I can only phone from the telephone box in the middle of the traffic island at the junction of Shirley Road, Olton Boulevard East and Wetherby Road. It costs 2d to make a call. One lifts the receiver, listens for the dialling tone, inserts two pennies in the box then dials the number. When the person answers, we press Button &ldquo;A&rdquo;; if there is no reply, Button &ldquo;B&rdquo;, then the money is returned. For long-distance calls we have to dial &ldquo;0&rdquo; for Operator and give them the number.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The only people we know who are on the telephone are Mr. &amp; Mrs. Moore at 54 Ulverley Green Road, Olton, Birmingham 27. Mr. Moore works for Premier Electric at Keeley Street, and also runs the Mission where we go on Sundays.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to Hartfield Crescent School this morning to see Mrs. Wright and Mr. Olarenshaw. I did a few jobs and helped with the class. I have always wanted to be a teacher.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My school report has come:&mdash;</P>

<TABLE bgcolor="#ffffcc" align=center border=0 CELLPADDING=4><TR><TD>ENGLISH<TD>He has worked well and made good progress. (Mr.&nbsp;T.R.&nbsp;Parry)</TR>

<TR><TD>MATHEMATICS<TD>Very weak, both in term and examination. (Mr.&nbsp;N.J.F.&nbsp;Craig)</TR>
<TR><TD>PHYSICS<TD>Moderate progress. (Mr. O.M.&nbsp;Mathews)</TR>
<TR><TD>CHEMISTRY<TD>Only fair. (Mr. J.B.&nbsp;Guy)</TR>
<TR><TD>BIOLOGY<TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ARTS &amp; CRAFTS<TD>He is working well with pleasing results. (Mr.&nbsp;J.B.&nbsp;Hurn)</TR>
<TR><TD></TR>
<TR><TD>FORM MASTER<TD>Not entirely satisfactory. He will have to make a bigger effort next term to reach the required standard. 14th in Form Order. (Mr.&nbsp;T.R.&nbsp;Parry)</TR>
<TR><TD>HEADMASTER<TD>French, English and Art seem to be going very well. He might gain in determination generally if he decides that now is the time to master elementary mathematics. T.E.B.H.&nbsp;(Mr.&nbsp;Howarth)</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>It is the worst report I have ever had. I have always been excellent at Maths. Last year Mr. Traynor said I was &ldquo;very good indeed&rdquo;, so why does Mr. Craig say I am &ldquo;very weak&rdquo;? If I still need to &ldquo;master elementary mathematics&rdquo; why was I placed in C2 and not C6?</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;An odd thing happened. We recently had Logarithms for prep. but on our way to school on the Special Bus John and I found we had completely different answers. John asked how I had worked them out and, using my method, arrived at exactly the same answers. So when we handed in our prep it was identical.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;John is very good at Maths, so when Mr. Craig asked him how he had managed to get all the answers wrong, John explained the method he had used without (so far as I can remember) telling him it was my fault. Does Mr. Craig think that I sit next to John so that I can copy his work? Is that why he has such a low opinion of me?</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon Mam took us to the Olton to see <I>Kelly the Second</I> (U), a comedy with Patsy Kelly and Charlie Chase, and <I>The Lone Wolf in London</I> (A), a detective film. They were both very good. There have been about a dozen Lone Wolf films since 1935 but this one came out last year. The <I>Kelly the Second</I> film was made in 1936. I expect that Patsy Kelly being in it is just a coincidence.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking through this Diary I see that I started using the &ldquo;Addresses O&ndash;S&rdquo; page to keep a list of the books I borrowed from Acocks Green Public Library. I have two tickets, one for fiction and one for non-fiction, and have two books out at a time, usually on pond-life, birds or astronomy etc. Unfortunately I have forgotten to record most of them. Those I have listed, together with the Library Number are:&mdash;</P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<I>Sea Shore</I> by Rev. Theodore Wood, J 591.92 W7<BR>
<I>Observer&rsquo;s Book of British Birds</I>, by S. Vere Benson, J&nbsp;598.2942 B35<BR>
<I>Hero of Crampton School</I>, by G. Forsyth Grant, J 48 G5<BR>
<I>Chums at Last</I>, by G. Forsyth Grant, J 48 G2<BR>
<I>The Beresford Boys</I>, by G. Forsyth Grant<BR>
<I>Observer&rsquo;s Book of British Wild Flowers</I><BR>
</P>

<P></BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not going to read any more of G. Forsyth Grant&rsquo;s books, as they are all the same, very old-fashioned and sentimental, set in boys&rsquo; schools where one of the boys gets killed or loses an arm, resulting in two other boys who are bitter enemies becoming friends.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[The books are very old. Mrs Forsyth Grant was born in Edinburgh in 1858 and died in 1926 aged 88. Her maiden name was Annie Gregory. <I>The Boys at Penrohn</I> was published in 1893 by W.P. Nimmo, Hay &amp; Mitchell, who also published <I>The Hero of Crampton School</I> in 1895, and <I>Burke&rsquo;s Chum</I> 1896; <I>Chums at Last</I> was published by Nelson &amp; Sons in1899, and <I>The Beresford Boys</I> by W.P. Nimmo, Hay &amp; Mitchell in 1906. Mrs Grant contributed to many journals, including <I>Boy&rsquo;s Own Paper</I> and <I>Vanity Fair</I>.]</P>

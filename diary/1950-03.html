<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Physics this morning we wrote up our own notes as Mr. Gess was busy marking papers. In Geography we had to write an essay on the Lake District.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time I played football. Nothing else happened all day.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I had quite a lot of homework to do.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had a short Geography test during second period this morning &amp; in Maths we also had a &ldquo;test&rdquo; which we have had to finish for prep. tonight.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was raining in J.T.C. so we did map work. I came home on the 31A bus from town.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We have been without a fire for a fortnight but we had 9 cwt. of coal this afternoon so I was able to make a fire.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam has been to Kidderminster for the day [to see Aunt Doll and Uncle Bill and Dorothy, and cousin Bill and Ruth] and has not yet returned.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is 9.15 and I have spent all tonight doing homework.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing whatsoever has happened at school today. I got 18/25 for yesterday&rsquo;s Maths test which was the second best, I think.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone who plays &ldquo;foolish pranks&rdquo; on Mr. Jackson will get the cane from Mr. Gess. I wonder what will happen now? All last week our form room was kept locked as a punishment but operations soon recommenced. Today&rsquo;s instalment included the pouring of [evil-smelling] carbon disulphide in ink wells. On at least two occasions this term all the desks have been faced the other way.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got home from school I fetched my M.M. and <I>The Listener</I> [from Dorlings] then did homework &mdash; French, Maths and Physics.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam &amp; Dad are at the cinema. [They have gone to the Olton to see <I>I Wonder Who&rsquo;s Kissing Her Now</I> (U) and Laurel &amp; Hardy in <I>Dancing Masters</I> (U).]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At school nothing happened, as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got home I cycled to the B&rsquo;ham City v Huddersfield match. Brennan scored after 33 seconds. In the second half, after Huddersfield had equalised Dailey scored and Blues won by 2 goals to 1. It was not at all a bad game. Birmingham&rsquo;s record is now:&mdash;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad and I have spent all day in the garden again &amp; the path and steps are now complete. Two thirds of the new flower bed has been dug [<I>sic</I>].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We also took out the old straw [from Ginger&rsquo;s bed] in the shed &amp; replaced it with new. The straw we burnt on the new rubbish heap.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Poetry today [English, first period] I read <I>The Ice-Cart</I> by Wilfred Gibson to the form. [I was embarrassed when Mr. Vaughan asked me why I liked it. I said &ldquo;it appeals to me&rdquo; and the boys laughed, but Mr. Vaughan stuck up for me.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. we did various [items of] drill followed by field signals revision.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went down to Athletics Standards. I had a go at the 100 yards &amp; just failed to get the standard. In the long jump I still have to clear another four inches.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came straight home through town &amp; went to the Scout Shop [in Dale End].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I spent well over three hours doing prep. I also went to the Library &amp; took Ginger for her evening walk as Dad had got &lsquo;flu. Clarice &amp; Julia have also got the &rsquo;flu.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time I played football as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In History we had a short test and in Chemistry we started on Sulphur Dioxide.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up late this morning. After breakfast Reg and Ruth came [Mam&rsquo;s brother is nearly 23]. I spent some time reading.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went for a ride to Knowle. At Knowle I turned off down Kenilworth Road until I came to the canal. Here there were five locks. I met a young man here and we carried on along the canal until it went under the Warwick Road and I had to say goodbye. I got a puncture in Knowle &amp; I cycled as far as Solihull with a flat tyre.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I had a bath &amp; then looked through my <I>Scout</I>s [which Mr. Harvey, who lives at 133, gives me each week; he is the Group Scout Master].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;For various reasons I was late arriving at Rubery today for Field Day. I wasn&rsquo;t long catching up the rest of the Platoon however.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;First we went in fours to stalk a rubbish dump then we did some judging of distances, after which we ate dinner.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the afternoon we had to get as close to a ramp as possible without being seen. Next we walked to a bridge about &frac34; mile away &amp; we were asked questions about the route we had taken.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Lastly, having individually &ldquo;stalked&rdquo; the bridge, we went along the Railway cutting &amp; wrote a message.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After the tea in the Dining Hall [back at school] there was a Variety (?) Show.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went in the Five-Mile Walk and got the Open (over 16) &amp; Intermediate Standards. The Open Standard was 60 mins. I think I did it in about 56 minutes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At School nothing has happened again. [It is a regular occurrence].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went by &rsquo;bus to the match. I could not cycle as I strained a muscle in my leg rather badly today playing football. Blues&rsquo; opponents &mdash; Man. City &mdash; had only two more points [than Birmingham City] so the match was worth four points really. Blues:&mdash; Merrick; Badham, Jennings; Dorman, Atkins, Ferris; Stewart, Berry, Dailey, Brennan, Warhurst. Warhurst was making his debut. [He has joined Birmingham City from Sheffield United]. In Manchester&rsquo;s side were Westcott &amp; Trautmann their German goalie. The only goal, by Brennan, came 18 secs. from the end.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;All this morning Bob and I spent mending a couple of punctures, one in each tyre. We took both wheels off to do the job.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I helped Dad who was mending the table leg &amp; Clarice and I also took Hound for a run in the park. We hope that in the very near future we shall get all the damaged furniture repaired &amp; re-polished &amp; also get the sitting room done. [The furniture was rescued from 23 Belchers Lane after the house was destroyed in the great air raid of 19th&ndash;20th November 1940].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As it is, the side-board from the sitting room has been moved to Mam &amp; Dad&rsquo;s room, in place of the tallboy which has gone to Bob&rsquo;s room. In our room we have got Bob&rsquo;s dressing table [not his, but the one which was in his room.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our council house has three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. Mam and Dad have the big front bedroom, Bob sleeps in the small front bedroom over the front door, and I share the back bedroom with Clarice and Julia.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Downstairs we have a front room which I call the lounge, a back room or sitting room where we have our meals and listen to the wireless, and a kitchen off which is the coal-house. This coal-house is actually the space under the stairs and has boards across the bottom so that, when the door is opened, the coal doesn&rsquo;t fall into the kitchen.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When the coalmen call, they usually deliver 10 cwt of coal, scattering coal-dust all over the kitchen, so we plan to have the coal put outside and to convert the inside coal-house into a pantry. We do have a pantry, but stupidly it is on the front of the house next to the front door and faces the staircase].</P>

[He is very evangelical and in four years Billy Graham is going to preach at his church, St. Martin&rsquo;s in the Bull Ring.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to bed at 8.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In second period this morning, History, Counsell [who is going to be a vicar, said something as the result of which] a discussion started about the Parliamentary reforms of 1830. It became obvious, however, that the discussion was going to turn to politics sooner or later.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;For a Chemistry essay on Rare Gases I got 17/20 which is rather unusually good for me just lately. In Maths we are still doing Calculus.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the No. 11 [Outer Circle] bus from Selly Oak.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I read a comic, went down the village, took Ginger out and did prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to Cubs tonight of course.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happened at School today. After dinner I went to an extra parade for Cert. A.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the Special Bus and tonight I got my Physics and Chemistry note-books up to date, as well as doing other homework.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Whalley was again absent today for Geography so Mr. Copland took us.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. we did general revision including Rifle 5 and 6 (H.A.T.) and drill. We take Cert A. Part 1 on Monday, all day. I came straight home after school.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I had to go to Jay&rsquo;s Shop on Coventry Road for Mam, so I cycled. The whole thing took me about fifty minutes. When I got back I did some work in the garden until six o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As I had no prep to do I went to bed at 8.15pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In P.T. today we went outside and played football. In Geography Mr. Kay took us.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the dinner hour I had another extra parade.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 2.30 there was a 3rd Julian Horner Concert in Big School given by Denis Mulgan (Oboe &amp; Cor Anglais) &amp; Katharine Thomson (Harpsichord). Included were Handel&rsquo;s Sonata No. 1 in C Minor &amp; Bach&rsquo;s French Suite in E Major, &amp; Sinfonia to Cantata No. 156.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up first (as usual) this morning and made a pot of tea.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast I went to Grandad&rsquo;s to take him the binoculars [as he was going to the races at Bromford Bridge]. I came back via the 15B &rsquo;bus route, Coventry Road and Stratford Road from Camp Hill.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went down to the park with the boys who played Cricket. I scored for them.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I played for a bit and from 7.30 till 8.10 I played &ldquo;Crib&rdquo; with Dad.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast this morning I went down the village to do a little shopping. Later on Mam took Ginger to Hall Green [Greyhound Racing Association stadium in York Road] for a trial. She did 30.56 seconds so they decided to keep her at the track. I hope that she will be alright and not grieve.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I finished putting some photos in a snapshot album which I bought this morning, and I also tidied up my books. I packed my school books ready for Thursday. After I had listened to &ldquo;Mrs. Dale&rsquo;s Diary&rdquo; I played out until 6.0pm. It is now 8 o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning at 10.45am I went to see the Racing Manager at Hall Green in order to give him some forms etc., concerning Ginger. He said that Ginger was not too bad at all.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I decided to go to the County Ground where Warwickshire C.C.C. were playing the Midland Cricket Club Conference for whom Mr. Guy [my Chemistry master] was playing. M.C.C.C. scored 97 (J.B. Guy b Grove 5) and Warwickshire were 220 for 44 when I left at five past six.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I went out to play for 30 mins.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up at 9.15am this morning. During the morning I went down the village with Mam.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had dinner early and then at 12.45 I went with Kipper [Christopher Martin], John [Maund], Phil [Martin], Connie [Hugh Constable], and [Ian] Hunt, and Mr. and Mrs. Martin to Cadbury&rsquo;s [factory at Bournville. Philip and Hugh are both in the Lower Modern Languages Division, and Ian in V.X. We all live in Acocks Green &mdash; John at 92 Shirley Road, the Martins at 8 Oxford Road, Hugh at 6 Grayland Close, and Ian at 302 Olton Boulevard East].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;First we saw a film &mdash; &ldquo;Cocoa Harvest&rdquo;. Then a woman took us all around the works. We saw the bars of chocolate being made and automatically wrapped, how cocoa was made, and we watched cocoa tins [being] made out of small sheets of tin. We saw biscuits made and also Dairy Milk chocolate. Cartons were also produced there. We ate a few samples and afterwards had a lovely tea. I arrived home at 5.50pm. It had been an extremely interesting afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Back to school again this morning. I felt pleased to be back somehow. I was early enough to catch the Special Bus. In Big School we sang <I>Lord, behold us with Thy blessing</I> as we usually do on first day back. I forgot my dog-licence [bus pass] again.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[My form master] Mr. Parry is back again. First period we went to Form Rooms [ours is 148] and then we carried on with the normal time-table. In J.T.C. we had a revision of arms drill. We also cleaned our rifles and had a rifle inspection immediately afterwards.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After J.T.C. I played football [still wearing my uniform]. From a kick off I raced through and scored a goal but someone on the opposing side was in our goalmouth so I took the free-kick and scored off that with a very long range shot.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;What a rush I had to get to school this morning. It was after 8.30am when I set out but I caught the bus O.K.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened at school. I could not get a game of football at dinner time. [There is usually a crowd of boys. The two captains select their teams one by one, the best players first until they have a full side. I am usually the last one to be chosen, so I do not always get a game. Duggins is the best player and everyone laughs when he chose me first. Bryan Peters who is called &ldquo;Twinkle-toes&rdquo; is very good too.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the Special Bus and played out until 5.45pm. From 6.30 to 9 o&rsquo;clock I have been doing Maths prep. Mam and Dad are at the cinema. They have gone to the Olton to see Gregory Peck and Ann Todd in <I>The Paradine Case</I> (A)<center><small><i>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school finished I came home with John and Kipper in the Martins&rsquo; car, so I was home for a quarter to one.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had dinner straight away and then at 1.30pm, I went to see the School XI v The Staff XI at Eastern Road. [It was a novelty to see all the masters in cricket attire, especially the Head. He took two catches!] I had to come away at 5 o&rsquo;clock when School declared at 121 for 6 wickets. Hobbs scored 45. [The match was drawn, the Staff still needing 22 runs to win with only 3 wickets left:</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner we went to the Mission where Mr. J. Harkness was the speaker. He spoke about the Book of Jude. [It was very good: I copied down what he wrote on the board:</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I caught the Special Bus as usual this morning.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At school [I learned that Saturday&rsquo;s match was drawn. Mr. Guy scored 16 and the Head got only 8 before being lbw bowled Lobb. The Staff could muster only 99 for 7, so were still needing 23 to win which I don&rsquo;t think they would have got.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;House meetings were held at 10.30am. After Chemistry, in the dinner hour I had Choir practice.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been chosen with four or five other trebles to sing at the Barber Institute on May 25th at 7.0 [as a Cupid in the Masque <I>Venus and Adonis</I> by John Blow (c.1649&ndash;1708). We shall not have far to go as the Barber Institute of Fine Arts is across the road, between the school and the University. It was founded by Lady Barber in memory of her husband in 1932; Professor Thomas Bodkin is the Director. The building was opened by Queen Mary on July 26th 1939, but I have never been inside].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got full marks for a Maths test we did last week. I wish I could do that in exams. In Scripture Mr. Parry asked why I didn&rsquo;t go to the School Play last year. I replied that I didn&rsquo;t care all that much for Shakespeare. [It was a silly answer but I didn&rsquo;t like to say I was embarrassed to ask my parents for the money: it cost 2/6.] Then he gave us an essay for unruly behaviour!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school I went to the form Cricket practice. I caught Rainbow for a duck, then I batted and collected 0 not out.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At school, 3rd period, we had a short Latin test. In Craft I started a stone carving of a sea-lion.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Afterwards I played football until five to two when we had to reassemble in form rooms so that we could all go together down to Bristol Road to line the route of the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Elizabeth were taking on their way to Selly Oak Hospital. We sat down on the grass by the road. We had to wait for half an hour at least. The Princess and the Duke had previously visited the B.I.F. [British Industries Fair] at Castle Bromwich.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I walked back to town with John as no trams were running. While waiting for an ice cream in Woolworth&rsquo;s I met Mam, so we came back together. There were thousands of people in and around the city centre [and hundreds of Birmingham and Midland Red buses, and also West Bromwich buses, which draw up in Livery Street alongside Snow Hill station. The picture is of Birmingham City Transport No.1012, and the map shows all the B.C.T. routes.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I played football at dinner time and scored a goal. In Geography Mr. Whalley took us outside the School weather station. I came home on the S.B., did some prep. then played out until nearly seven.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea (my second) I had a bath then blancoed my gaiters etc. and did one or two odd jobs which I wanted to do.</P>

I bought an ice-cream in the Milk Bar then came home via Town. I bought an English-French, French-Eng. dictionary at Woolworth&rsquo;s.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I did prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time I scored two goals.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much else happened at school. I came home on the Special Bus as usual. Then I went [to Dorlings] to get my B.O.P. and M.M. [<I>Boy&rsquo;s Own Paper</I> and <I>Meccano Magazine</I>] and played out for some time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I have been doing prep. I listened on the radio to &ldquo;Ignorance is Bliss&rdquo; and Excerpts from the opera <I>Rigoletto</I> by Verdi.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I stayed out in the garden. Grandad came during the afternoon. In the evening after he had gone home, Mam and I got the hose-pipe out and we watered every bit of the garden. There has been no rain for several days. The garden looked so refreshed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When we had had dinner I took down all the latest weather readings and continued my essay out in the garden.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I again watered the garden.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday I stuck in [my Diary] a 2nd series of prehistoric monsters of 60&ndash;200 million years ago. Most of them were stupid but the fierce ones were the protoceratops (page 123), tinoceras (143), cotylosaur (115), dimetrodon (125). One of the most ferocious was a fish minus teeth &mdash; the dinichthys (133).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I forgot my [<I>Venus &amp; Adonis</I>] music this morning so in the dinner hour I came home to get it. I was back at school for 1.55pm. I did not sign the late book and I wasn&rsquo;t down as absent.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Jackson was taking the History period and there was quite a chaos of course. (Mr. Whalley took the English period this morning.)</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 2.25 I had to go across to the Barber Institute for a rehearsal [with Professor Anthony Lewis. He has been Professor of Music at the University since 1947, and is very interested in 16th-18th century music.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We rehearsed for an hour then at 3.45pm] I caught the S.B. home.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea was the Masque <I>Venus &amp; Adonis</I> at 7 o&rsquo;clock. With the Boyd Neel Orchestra and Joy McArden as Venus &amp; Margaret Field-Hyde as Cupid everything went extremely well. Professor Anthony Lewis was the conductor. Adonis was sung by Donald Munro.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[<I>Venus &amp; Adonis</I> is rarely performed and we had a full audience (370) tonight. It was put on by Rutland Boughton at Glastonbury in 1922. Rutland Boughton is connected with Birmingham &mdash; he studied under Granville Bantock at the Birmingham School of Music &mdash; and <I>The Immortal Hour</I> was staged by Sir Barry Jackson at the Repertory Theatre in 1932.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Boyd Neel Orchestra is quite famous. Dr. Louis Boyd Neel went to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. He planned a career in the Royal Navy, but became a doctor instead. However, the Orchestra he had started became such a success that he gave up medicine for music. The Orchestra has travelled all over the world. Dr. Boyd Neel has also conducted many other orchestras, including Glyndebourne, Sadlers Wells and the D&rsquo;Oyly Carte.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know why Dr. Boyd Neel was not conducting tonight. I suppose this orchestra was the &ldquo;reserves&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I caught the S.B. at Shaftmoor Lane. In J.T.C. we had a talk on attacking the enemy etc. Then we did drill until 1.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came straight home and spent all the afternoon doing homework, but I did go out to play for half and hour at 5 o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I wrote down a complete list of all the gramophone records and made a sort of catalogue of them.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ginger was only 4th last night at Hall Green but I have got several more newspaper cuttings.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened today. It rained all through the dinner hour. Our [Boys&rsquo;] Special Bus did not turn up so we came home on the Girls&rsquo; Special.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I have been doing homework. Mam and Dad have gone to the cinema as usual and Bob will not be in yet. I am going to bed at 9 o&rsquo;clock straight after &ldquo;Hi Gang&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Bournville Sports Carnival which I hope to go to tomorrow is advertised in tonight&rsquo;s <I>Mail</I>, and also tomorrow night&rsquo;s Youth for Christ Rally. This will be held simultaneously in the Town Hall and Midland Institute, with an American team including Billy Graham, Bob Cook and Cliff Barrows.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to school in J.T.C. uniform this morning in case I went to the Gymkhana this afternoon. (I say J.T.C., I should say C.C.F. &mdash; yesterday I sewed new shoulder titles on my battledress:</P>

<P>BIRMINGHAM C.C.F.</P>

</DIV>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school I went to see Mr. [Major] Leeds to see whether or not I should go to the Gymkhana or the Bournville Sports as I had promised to go with Jennens to the latter. He suggested that I put in an appearance at the Gymkhana then go to the other afterwards.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We paraded in the playground then marched down to the [Eastern Road] ground, holding up the trams and cars etc. while we went across the Bristol Rd.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I arrived at the Bournville Sports Carnival at 2.45. There were plenty of thrills (and spills). I really enjoyed it all. So did Jennens. (He lives not too far from Bournville, at 50 Senneleys Park Road, Northfield.)</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning before breakfast I wrote up all my chemistry notes and did some other prep afterwards. I went out to play for a short time and also helped Dad to cut the front hedges before dinner.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I stayed in during the afternoon. After tea I went out to play until 7.40pm. Grandad came but he couldn&rsquo;t stay long.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At school nowadays, there is always a rush down to the Milk Bar, or, as it is now called, the &ldquo;Tuck Shop&rdquo;, to get milk, Ice Cream and Sweets and Chocolates. All the shops in Acocks Green sold out ages ago.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Chemistry I worked with Jennens as usual. I had Choir practice at dinner time, of course, so I didn&rsquo;t play football. Nothing much else happened. In Scripture we continued the series of talks. I came home on the Special Bus.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I have been doing homework.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened at school today. I came straight home after school and did all my homework this afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 5.15pm I was back at school for the concert this evening. Mam, Dad, Bob, Clarice and Julia came on afterwards. The concert started at 7.30. The choir sang:&mdash;</P>

<P>(1) a. <I>The Ash Grove</I></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;b. <I>The Angler&rsquo;s Song</I></P>

<P>(9) a. <I>Tom&rsquo;s Gone to Hilo</I></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;b. <I>The Drummer &amp; the Cook</I></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;c. <I>Shenandoah</I></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;d. <I>Billy Boy</I></P>

<P>(10) <I>Nothing is here for tears</I> [(Vaughan Williams) together with the orchestra.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The other items on the programme were, to begin with, <I>Let us now praise famous men</I> (Vaughan Williams) with the choir and orchestra:<I></P>

<P><I>Nocturne in E Minor</I> (Chopin) played by J.S. Williamson (piano) and J.B. Ludlow (violin);</P>

<P>Bach&rsquo;s <I>Concerto in C for two pianos and strings</I> (1st movement) played by A.J. Cooke and T.F.H. Oxley with the string section of the orchestra;</P>

<P><I>Allegretto and Gigue for flute, violin, cello and piano</I>, composed by T.F.H. Oxley, who played the piano;</P>

<P><I>Introduction</I> and <I>Rondo Capriccioso</I> (Saint-Saens) played by Mr. F.J. Williams (piano) and J.B. Ludlow (violin);</P>

<P>The <I>Trumpet Voluntary</I> (Jeremiah Clarke) played by A.J. Homer, with trombone, organ, tympani, side drum, cymbals etc. This was brilliant, but when it came to the Sea-Shanties, with the Orchestra supporting us and R.T. Popple singing the bass solo, we brought the house down!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Altogether] I thought the concert was the best one that has been held since I&rsquo;ve been at K.E.S., especially as there were printed programmes (3d ea.!!).</P>

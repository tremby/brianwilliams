<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today was Speech Day in Big School. I sang in the Choir. The Lord Mayor (Councillor J.C. Burman) was there. The Head Master (Mr. Morris) made a speech then invited the Bishop of Birmingham (Dr. Barnes, who is an Old Edwardian) to present the prizes. Dr. Barnes spoke, followed by the Lord Mayor, then Mr. Morris presented various Cups and Trophies. We ended by singing <I>Jerusalem</I> and the National Anthem.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a Civics Society meeting after school but I didn&rsquo;t go.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandad will be 65 tomorrow. He has now retired from the G.P.O., Fordrough Lane, where he has been a cabinet maker. He and Granma have lived at 23 Pretoria Road, Bordesley Green, for many years, and Granma died there on Sunday 24th November last year. They came originally from Nottingham but moved to Birmingham when Dad was quite young. Dad can not remember exactly when that was but he was born in 1907 so if he was 7 when they moved to Birmingham, that would be 1914, about the time of the Great War.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Fred, Dad&rsquo;s younger brother, still lives with Grandad. Grandad&rsquo;s mother, my great-grandmother, also lived with them until shortly before she died, at Western Road Infirmary, on Monday 16th December 1940&mdash;a month after we got bombed out. Aunt Edna, Dad&rsquo;s elder sister, and Uncle Albert (Ricketts) live at 61 Colonial Road, which is two streets away from Pretoria Road, with Botha Road in between. They have 5 children (my cousins):&mdash; Allen who is 20, Iris (16), Reggie (14), Bobby (7) and Margaret (6), so Grandad has 3 children and 8 grandchildren. Mam and Dad and Clarice (who was only about 1) stayed with them after we lost our home.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I later discover that Ernest Alfred Williams was born, on Wednesday 11th October 1882, at 52 Coalpit Lane, Nottingham. His parents were Edward Henry Williams (born 12th March 1858 at Havelock Street, Nottingham) and Mary Elizabeth Barker (born 1861 or 1862, presumably also in Nottingham). They were married at St Matthias&rsquo;s Parish Church, Sneinton, on Sunday 9th April 1882 when Edward was 24 and Mary 19. He was a lace-making machinist and she a lace-worker.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Although I was only 5 when Great-granma Williams died I can remember her quite well, especially her saying not to leave the spout of the kettle pointing outwards where someone could get scalded as it sat on the hob boiling the water on the back room fire. The front room is hardly ever used, except for laying people out when they die: Granma last year, then Grandad in 1962 and finally Fred in 1965. The Williams&rsquo; tenure of the house will then be ended after more than 40 years.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We went to the Mission as usual. Recently, I asked Mr. Moore if I could have one of the little <I>Alexander&rsquo;s Hymns No. 3</I> which we use every week. I have been singing these hymns all my life and know some of them off by heart, such as <I>There is a green hill far away</I> (No. 304) which was the first hymn I ever learned. My other favourite hymns include:&mdash;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<I>One day when heaven was filled with His praises</I> 205<BR>
<I>Standing on the promises of Christ my King</I> 160<BR>
<I>Jesus, I am resting, resting, in the joy of what Thou art</I> 164<BR>
<I>Jesus is all the world to me</I> 98<BR>
<I>Like a river glorious is God&rsquo;s perfect peace</I> 67<BR>
<I>I was sinking deep in sin, sinking to rise no more</I> 379<BR>
<I>What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought</I> 378<BR>
<I>Take my life, and let it be, consecrated, Lord, to Thee</I> 248<BR>
<I>What a Friend we have in Jesus</I> 195<BR>
<I>I&rsquo;m pressing on the upward way</I> 165<BR>
<I>Why should I charge my heart with care?</I> 143<BR>
<I>When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word</I> 53<BR>
<I>Simply trusting every day</I> 44<BR>
<I>How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds in a believer&rsquo;s ear</I> 256<BR>
<I>Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go</I> 100
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The little hymn-books measure 5&frac12;&ldquo; x 4 <SUP>3</SUP>/<SUB>16</SUB>&rdquo; and are very worn, having been in use from before the War. They have red covers and were printed by Marshall Brothers Ltd., London and Edinburgh; with Paper Covers 2d. net; Cloth, 3d. net. Music edition: Paper Covers, 2s. 6d. net; Cloth boards, 3s. 6d. net. Miss Stanley, who plays for us, has the Cloth boards edition.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[In 2003 I still treasure the little hymn book given me by Mr. Moore 56 years ago. But only recently have I at last been able to acquire the music edition &mdash; and in near-perfect condition, except for the faded spine. This gives me the names of the hymn-writers and the composers, which (since neither are given in the words-only edition) I have not known until now. No. 67, for instance, was written by Frances Ridley Havergal, with music by Rev. J. Mountain, who also composed the music for No. 164. Frances Ridley Havergal also wrote No. 248. The tune for No. 44 was written by Ira D. Sankey of Moody &amp; Sankey. It is a coincidence that No. 143 and 53 were both written by Rev. J.H. Sammis with music by D.B. Towner. John Newton wrote the words of No. 256.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;<I>There is a green hill</I> is by Mrs. C.F. Alexander (1818&ndash;1895), who also wrote <I>Once in royal David&rsquo;s city</I> (No. 322), <I>Jesus calls us: o&rsquo;er the tumult</I> (288) and many other hymns. She was much influenced by the Oxford Movement. In 1850, as Cecil Frances Humphreys, she married Rev. William Alexander who subsequently became Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, and (after her death) Bishop of Armagh. He is not the Alexander who has given his name to the hymn book.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Charles M. Alexander (1867&ndash;1920) was song-leader for the great evangelists Dr. R.A. Torrey (1856&ndash;1928) and J. Wilbur Chapman (1859&ndash;1918). He was an American but had a home in (or near) Birmingham, and was buried at Lodge Hill cemetery.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;A decade hence from this Diary entry, I shall conduct my first Evangelistic and Healing Campaign at Silloth, Cumberland, 21st October to 4th November 1957.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We have had heavy snow again today.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is exactly seven years tonight since we were bombed out of 23 Belchers Lane. When the air raid siren sounded on Tuesday night, we had heard it over a hundred times since mid-August. Barrage balloons like silver elephants hung above us and searchlights pierced the sky. As the German bombers droned overhead with the eerie vibrating noise we had come to recognise, fighter planes and Ack-Ack guns tried to shoot them down. The noise was terrific. When a bomb fell there was an awful whistling noise then a momentary eerie silence before it exploded.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The raid lasted all night. Bombs fell all around us and the ground shook beneath us. The land-mine fell at the bottom of the garden &mdash; where the Anderson shelter was &mdash; and when we clambered out at daybreak I could see the sky where the roof and ceiling had been. The front of the piano was blown out and standing on the opposite side of the room. The floor was strewn with glass and plaster and and splintered wood, but my Dinky toys somehow survived. Later I saw that close to where the shelter had been was a huge crater filled with water, with a bath from someone&rsquo;s house half-submerged in it.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Almost the entire city came under attack that night. 615 people were killed and over 1,000 injured, 542 of them seriously. Our house was all but destroyed and we never lived in it again, but it was eventually rebuilt, as the picture shows. [Traces of the Red Cardinal with which Mam had polished the bricks were still visible decades later.]</P>

The cover has now been embossed in gold with the seal of &ldquo;King Edward VI Grammar Schools Birmingham&rdquo; and a plate stuck inside the cover, &ldquo;B.D. Williams, Form 1B, July 1947&rdquo;. I shall treasure it always.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to the match as usual. Birmingham City beat Sheffield Wednesday 1&ndash;0 (an own goal) at St. Andrews.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Birmingham City:&mdash; Wheeler; Green, Jennings; Harris, Duckhouse, Mitchell; Goodwin, McIntosh, Garrett, Bodle, Edwards. . Gil Merrick is injured so Jack Wheeler was in goal, and Archie Garrett is a new player from Northampton Town. Walter Aveyard, who has played only a few games for Blues, has had to give up playing because of injury.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening we went to the Warwick Cinema to see <I>The Jolson Story</I> with Larry Parks and Evelyn Keyes. It was enormously popular when it was released last year, so it has come round again. Al Jolson featured in <I><I>The Jazz Singer</I></I>, the first talking film, which came out in 1927. He is now about 61, so Larry Parks takes his part, but it is Jolson&rsquo;s voice singing the songs.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The other film was <I><I>Royal Wedding</I></I>. [In 1951 there will be an American film of the same title set against the background of the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip, starring Fred Astaire, Jane Powell, Sarah Churchill and Peter Lawford, with songs by Alan Jay Lerner and Burton Lane.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Clarice was 8 today. I can remember the day she was born in 1939, and giving her a poppy; it was a Wednesday. I was born on a Wednesday, and Julia too &mdash; all three of us.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When the <I>Birmingham Mail</I> came at tea-time, I saw straight away that Mr. Morris&rsquo;s photo was on the front page. The article says &ldquo;K.E.S. Head May Go To Leeds &mdash; Nomination as Vice-Chancellor&rdquo;. It is quite a shock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The main headline is &ldquo;Arab-Jew War Can Be Avoided&rdquo;. There is going to be a new Jewish nation in Palestine, with Dr. Chaim Weizmann being suggested as its first President. He recommends that immigartion into the Jewish state should be controlled.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Two German P.O.W.s have escaped at Cleethorpes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I went to Dorling&rsquo;s as usual and waited for the <I>Sports Argus</I> to arrive. Birmingham City won 2&ndash;1 away to Tottenham Hotspur this afternoon. Garrett and Dougall scored.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Xmas Number of the <I>Sun</I> comic is on sale at the paper shop. It comes out fortnightly and costs 2d &mdash; this issue is dated Tuesday 23rd December 1947. I don&rsquo;t ever buy it as we get all our comics from Aunt Edna&rsquo;s after Allan, Iris, Reggie, Bobby and Margaret have finished with them. Dad has his dinner with Edna about once a week (he cycles from the B.S.A., Montgomery Street, to 61 Colonial Road, Bordesley Green) and brings a pile of comics home with him.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After we have finished reading them I have been taking the comics to Hartfield Crescent to give to the boys and girls in Mrs. Wright&rsquo;s class. I made columns in my Challenge Duplicate Book, wrote the children&rsquo;s names down the left hand side and the dates across the top, then put a tick in the appropriate box to ensure that each receives a comic in turn.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My favourite is <I>Film Fun</I> with Laurel &amp; Hardy on the front, Joe E. Brown, Old Mother Riley and her daughter Kitty (Arthur Lucan and Kitty McShane), Max Miller, Sydney Warner and Gene Autry &amp; Trigger and others inside; it is all in black &amp; white. We also get <I>Radio Fun</I>, which is black &amp; white and sepia brown, the <I>Knock-Out</I>, <I>The Beano</I> and <I>The Dandy</I>, which are in full colour, <I>Chicks Own</I> and <I>Tiger Tim</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The <I>Sun</I> and <I>Comet</I> are published by J.B. Allen, 10 Queen&rsquo;s Road, Sale, Cheshire, and printed by Rembrandt Photogravure Ltd., Watford. They are not so popular, but the latest <I>Sun</I> is quite good. It has Good King Wenceslas on the front cover, with pictures to match the words of the carol, and Sherwood Outlaw (Robin Hood) on the back. There is also a serial &ldquo;The Cruise of the Cormorant&rdquo; by Arthur Catherall, and other stories; Soccer Tips by Jack Bray (ex Manchester City and England, now manager of Watford F.C.), and an article for stamp-collectors, which is about the Christmas stamps issued by Hungary in 1943.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. W.E. Crowther has also retired. According to the <I>King Edward&rsquo;s School Chronicle</I> for December, he is an Old Edwardian and taught at K.E.G.S. Five Ways before becoming Art Master here in 1919. His son was killed in the War. I have seen a Mr. J.J. Hart in the Art Room but it has always been Mr. J.B. Hurn who has taught us.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Hurn only started here in September. Mr. W.L. Whalley, who takes us for Geography, was also new this term, and the other new masters are Mr. W.H. Babb, Mr. G.R.V. Dowling, Mr. A.C. Gosling, Mr. A. Hurrell, O.E., and Mr. R.M. Osborne.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today we all went to the Olton cinema to see <I>Scrooge</I> and <I>King of the Stallions</I>. <I>Scrooge</I> was very good.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have also had a Boots Scribbling Diary which I can use as a kind of scrapbook to record world events.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The snow is causing delays to buses and trains and affecting production in the factories.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There is quite a stir about Bishop Barnes&rsquo;s book, <I>The Rise of Christianity</I> and he is being condemned as a heretic.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[The book is published by Longmans, Green and Co. and has 356 pages. Nearly half-a-century later I buy a second-hand copy which is inscribed &ldquo;Hugh Ross Williamson 1947&rdquo; on the fly-leaf &mdash; the well-known broadcaster.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Barnes&rsquo;s book is dedicated to &ldquo;To my sons&rdquo;, one of whom, John Barnes, writes <I>Ahead of His Age &mdash; Bishop Barnes of Birmingham</I> (Collins, 1979). I send Sir John a copy of my article &ldquo;E.W. Barnes at K.E.S.&rdquo; printed in the <I>Birmingham Weekly Post</I>, 23rd December 1956, and containing hitherto unpublished material which I discovered.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My article about Dr. Barnes was thus published almost exactly 9 years after the above Diary entry.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Barnes&rsquo;s brother Sidney was a distinguished Warwickshire cricketer.]</P>

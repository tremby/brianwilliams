<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Maths today Mr. Craig was absent and so J.R. Charlesworth [who is a prefect] took us. After school Mr. Hurn showed me some super paintings of his.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went [on the tram] to town from school and then had a haircut. I was home for 2.15pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I did some homework and took Ginger for a walk (?) later. Ginger escaped from the lead and ran off down the road but I managed to catch her alright.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I did Geography prep. I am going to bed soon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Craig was still absent today, with &rsquo;flu, it is said. In Art I continued my oil-painting. In the dinner hour the form had to stay in for Mr. Whalley.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the special bus. I did some prep after I had had tea at 5.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not go to school this morning. I seemed to have caught a cold so I stayed in bed &mdash; the warmest place because today had been the coldest this year.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up at 2.45pm. I felt giddy when I came down. Tonight I did a lot of prep, including an English essay.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My cold does not seem any better today so I stayed in bed until nearly dinner time reading. Mam had gone to [the Midland Nerve] Hospital but the dinner was ready. I wrote up six pages of Chemistry notes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I did two ink paintings which took about two hours.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I started another picture and I also took two photographs of Ginger. I don&rsquo;t expect they&rsquo;ll be much good.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I wrote yesterday that it had been the coldest day of the year but it has been colder today.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning my cold seemed somewhat better when I got up at 8.30am, so I played outside for some time. I went down to the Library to take my two books back as well.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went to St Andrews where B&rsquo;ham City drew 0&ndash;0 with Burnley. It was not a good game by any means. [Boyd and Evans were playing in their first home game for Blues &mdash; they paid Plymouth Argyle &pound;17,500 for Boyd last week &mdash; but Bodle was playing out-of-position. They never looked like scoring. Birmingham City:&mdash; Merrick; Trigg, Green; Boyd, Duckhouse, Harris; Berry, Bodle, Dougall, Evans, Roberts. The gate was 35,000.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad took Ginger (&ldquo;Esor&rdquo;) to Hinckley for a trial. She ran the 500 yards in 31.50 secs, &mdash; her fastest to date [which means she will be able to race there now, but as Hinckley is an unofficial track &mdash; not registered with the National Greyhound Racing Association &mdash; we have to call her &ldquo;Esor&rdquo;, which is Mam&rsquo;s name spelt backwards].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing other than usual happened today. We took Ginger for a run as usual. It was lovely outside, the sun has shone all day.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I prepared some Variety Show programmes. Tonight I played &ldquo;Crib&rdquo; with Dad.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning the special bus had not turned up at 9.0am so we went on the 1A bus and arrived at school at 9.30. [The picture shows No. 1631, one of the new A.E.C. RT-type buses operating on this route.] Some boys at the College Arms waited for a long time then went to Moseley, &mdash; waited there &amp; where the special eventually arrived. We did not have to sign the Late Book.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing particular happened at school. [In Scripture I collected 2/8 Cot-Fund but] I got an essay impot [imposition] for forgetting my Bible.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight it has been raining since 4.30pm. I have been listening just, to &ldquo;The Man in Black&rdquo; telling a nice quiet tale [of horror].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happened at school this morning, though Dr. Willis Grant gave me a lift to town. [I was walking along Bristol Road when he stopped the car. It has a Birmingham registration with an &ldquo;O&rdquo; in the middle, DOX, and when I got in he told me the car&rsquo;s name was Arthur.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I finished another picture. I did very little prep: Geography I did yesterday, and Art and History I couldn&rsquo;t do because I was absent &mdash; that left just French.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to Scouts. From eight till 8.20pm we had map-reading, then we were split up into two patrols &mdash; Beavers (my patrol) and Lions. Then we did patrol work &mdash; signalling. I got home at 9.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At school today I scored perhaps my best goal ever (at school). It was a super long range shot.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I missed the special home. I played outside for an hour until 6.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The day has been rather unsettled. It has rained, been cloudy, and the sun has been shining at times. There is a strong wind blowing still and it is very cold.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I was a little late (or so I thought) so I went [up Olton Boulevard East] to Shaftmoor Lane. I thought the special had gone. Don Tipper and I went by 1A bus to Bristol Road and then we walked the rest of the way. We just managed to get in for 2nd bell.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. we had arms drill and a map-reading test. Afterwards I scored two goals in two minutes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 1.30pm Don and I went to Voluntary Art where I did some more of my oil painting.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight we went to the Olton to see <I>Heart of Virginia</I> and <I>The Fallen Idol</I> &mdash; both very good.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the dinner hour I played football for only 5 mins. but scored another goal. Afterwards [in the Armoury] I cleaned my rifle.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the Special Bus, and played out until 5.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am writing this diary at 8.30 and Mam and Dad have gone to the cinema. [<I>Springtime in the Rockies</I> (U) and <I>The Three Weird Sisters</I> (A) are on at the Warwick, and <I>The Fallen Idol</I> (A) and <I>Heart of Virginia</I> (U) at the Olton.]  I am playing some gramophone records.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning it was pouring with rain when I set out for school. I went on the special bus.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to St Andrews to see the B&rsquo;ham City v Everton match. The result was 0&ndash;0. Dailey was making his debut for the Blues. [Birmingham City:&mdash; Merrick; Trigg, Green; Boyd, Duckhouse, Harris; Stewart, Dougall, Dailey, Bodle, Roberts. The attendance was 35,000.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to Grandad&rsquo;s on the way home [walking along Garrison Lane and Bordesley Green, then turning down Pretoria Road where Grandad lives at No. 23] but he was out.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been cold all day long. While I was at the match Ginger was 3rd in her first ever race at Hinckley. Time approx 31.10 secs.&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I played Crib for three quarters of an hour.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There was the usual Choir Practice during the Dinner Hour. After school I had a House Choir Practice [with Fred Oxley to conduct us].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had a sick headache when I got home but I managed to do Physics, Maths and Latin homework.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am listening as usual to &ldquo;The Man in Black&rdquo;. It is 8.45pm. In a minute I shall go to bed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the special bus and was home for 4.30pm. Mrs. Harris came this afternoon. I played out until 6.30.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I got up at just after 8.30am. I took Ginger out and then made a pot of tea. After breakfast I played out and Dad and I took Ginger for a run.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent the afternoon doing prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I made a combined volume of <I>The ABC of British Railways</I> Parts I-IV which took me just over an hour. [I cut two pieces of grey cardboard for the front and back, the same size as the <I>ABC</I>s, and made a piece for the spine, fastening them together with a piece of red cloth; then made two end-papers which I stuck to the cover with brown sticky paper.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On the inside front cover I stuck the picture, from an old <I>ABC of GWR</I>, of an 0&ndash;6&ndash;0ST of the former Cardiff Railway, and facing it a newspaper picture of No. 6000 <I>King George V</I>. On the back of this are pictures of ex-LMS No. 5538 <I>Giggleswick</I> and No. 5530 <I>Sir Frank Ree</I> which I cut out of a <I>Meccano Magazine</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The next thing I had to do was to take the staples out of the four volumes and remove the covers. Using a pin, I made holes in the spine to match those in the four books, then stuck the staples through and re-fastened the books, without their covers, to make a presentable &ldquo;combined volume&rdquo;.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am going to bed soon as it is now 10 past 8.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing I did this morning was to take down all the 1948 Calendars and put up the new ones. We had more than usual this year.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I washed up and went to get some [horse-]meat for the dog [Ginger, our pet greyhound] on Stratford Road. It started to rain when I got back home &amp; soon the rain turned to snow. A cold wind had been blowing all morning.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon the rain had not stopped so I stayed indoors and listened to the Bristol Rovers v Notts C. match.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandad came this afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir Malcolm Campbell died today at Reigate, aged 63.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was dull this morning and it rained a little. I did not go out at all but I sorted amongst some of the photographs.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner we went to the Mission. I played Crib [Cribbage, with Dad] for half-an-hour before I went to bed at 9.0.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I awoke this morning the sun was shining and there were many starlings, sparrows and blackbirds singing in the garden. I read <I>Birds of the Grey Wind</I> by E.A. Armstrong for an hour. It is a beautifully written book and I really enjoy reading it. [It was a Christmas present from Mam and Dad.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was surprised when I found it was 10.30 when I got up. Mam had gone to town but the breakfast was ready.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was out all morning with Ginger. We had dinner at about 2.0 and I stayed in this afternoon. It has been a lovely day although it has been a little cold.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I woke up this morning to find that snow had fallen. What a change to [<I>sic</I>, from] yesterday, though I thought it was cold enough for snow.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast, having been down the village beforehand, I cleared the snow away from outside the house.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I played out all afternoon, and I went on down the village to try to get a pair of Wellingtons &mdash; in vain.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I went to Scouts [on the 44 bus from Acocks Green village to Baker Street, Sparkbrook]. We played Billiards and Snooker from 8.15 to 9.15.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The snow has very nearly gone now. I went to town this morning to go to the <I>[Birmingham] Mail</I> offices [in New Street].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went out to play.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I listened to Children&rsquo;s Hour, when a new drawing competition was announced. I shall probably send in an entry. Anyway, I spent two hours on a picture tonight.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a lovely day, the sun is shining &mdash; all the snow has disappeared. I spent another two hours on my picture this morning. I hope I won&rsquo;t have wasted my time on it when I finish.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went out to play.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When we had had tea we all went to the Olton Cinema to see Vivien Leigh, Kieron Moore and Ralph Richardson in <I>Anna Karenina</I> &mdash; a good film, though not for children. [I am not yet 13&frac12;, Clarice is just 8 and Julia is 6. We were all very upset when Vivien Leigh stood on the railway line to kill herself.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Together with this film was [a &ldquo;full supporting programme&rdquo; consisting of] a Disney cartoon &mdash; <I>Donald&rsquo;s Ostrich</I> and two other films, one about Gannets.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am writing this diary at 8.15pm. Mam and Dad are at the pictures [they have gone to the Warwick to see Margaret Lockwood and Vic Oliver in <I>I&rsquo;ll Be Your Sweetheart</I> (A) and Claude Rains, Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney in <I>The Wolf Man</I> (A)].

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to town this morning after I had been down the village three times. I had to go down a third time because I hadn&rsquo;t got any ration books for the meat.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went down the village again and afterwards I played out.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to Scouts as usual. We had Map-Reading and then P.T. I&nbsp;thoroughly enjoyed the map-reading probably because I knew almost all of it.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I decided to clean the shed window. Then I went out with Ginger for half-an-hour, played out for a bit and then came in at four.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Wakey wakey&rdquo; I thought as I stirred from my sleep this morning. Bother!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up quickly and dressed in my uniform. I must say I felt a bit queer as I walked down the village [wearing it to school for the first time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is my third year at K.E.S., my second term in Upper Middle D, and first term in the J.T.C. as I have joined late.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We were issued with fixture cards and pads first period this morning. We did mostly drill in J.T.C.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got home for 2.0pm and did my art prep after dinner.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I played &ldquo;Crib&rdquo; from ten to eight till half-past eight this evening.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I was a little late starting out for school so I caught a 31A &rsquo;bus to Shaftmoor Lane and got the Special Bus there.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today in Gym my team won 76% of the various relays, etc. Mr. Parry was not at school today. In the English period we wrote an essay. Mr. Copland took us for History in my old form-room [No. 149].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I caught the K.E.S. &rsquo;bus home as usual. I did my prep from 7.30 till 8.15pm. I only had French and Maths to do.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Clarice and Julia went to the B.S.A. party. Mam went to town, and Dad was out most of the time. I stayed in and listened to the Huddersfield v QPR match.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to the Library to renew two books and renew my ticket. I brought a book for myself which I read for the rest of the evening.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I caught the special [&rsquo;bus] home, did some prep. and then went down the village to fetch a pair of shoes [from being repaired at the cobbler&rsquo;s]. When I got home again I finished off my prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I played football after school.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;They make a wonderful collection and give us great delight every time we look at them. The cards are all in packets, mainly &ldquo;Park Drive&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wild Woodbine&rdquo; and a few others. Dad is not a smoker, but Grandad and Fred (Dad&rsquo;s brother) are, so I suppose they saved the cards, and Dad gave them to me. The packets are kept with lead soldiers and some other &ldquo;treasures&rdquo; in a small blue suitcase which I seem to have had all my life.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is 8.30pm. Mam and Dad are at the Cinema. I am at the table. Ginger is lying on the hearth.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At school today we had Chemistry and Maths tests.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went to the Library and at about 5.00pm I went to the Guild Social at St Andrews Street with Clarice and Julia. Mam and Dad arrived half-an-hour later. We had a very nice tea there. Afterwards we played various games until 9.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got into bed at about a quarter past eleven. I felt very tired.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning Dad and I took Ginger for a run in the park. I thought she ran faster than ever.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon we went to the Mission where Mr. Wheeler was the speaker.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I completed some Chemistry notes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing particular happened at school. We started on trigonometry in Maths. In Scripture I collected 4/- Cot-Fund and dealt with the Variety Show.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got home I did prep and then wrote a letter to the <I>Mail</I>. I wonder whether it will be published?</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am listening to <I>The Man in Black</I> [the first of a new series which I have been greatly looking forward to, introduced by Valentine Dyall.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight&rsquo;s story was <I>Markheim</I> by Robert Louis Stevenson. The programme used to be called <I>Appointment With Fear</I>, and I listened to it on Tuesday nights at 9.30pm after I got back from Cubs. Valentine Dyall has a very deep voice and introduces the programme each week &mdash; &ldquo;This is your story-teller, the Man in Black, bringing you another &hellip; APPOINTMENT WITH FEAR!&rdquo; Just to hear him say that sends a shiver down my spine, and some of the stories are terrifying!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The first series of <I>Appointment with Fear</I> began on Saturday night 11th September 1943, and a second series on Thursday 6th January 1944. The third series began on Sunday 13th March 1944, and the fourth on Thursday 5th October 1944. There was a fifth series, consisting of six repeats, from Tuesday 11th September 1945, followed immediately by a sixth series on Tuesday 23rd October 1945. The seventh series began on Tuesday 26th March 1946, the eighth on Tuesday 25th February 1947, and the ninth on Tuesday 14th January 1948. So tonight&rsquo;s programme has begun a tenth series.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have hardly put a pen down today. All morning I did Physics prep, and during the afternoon I wrote up several pages of notes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We watched &ldquo;What&rsquo;s My Line?&rdquo; as usual. For the second year running it has won the <I>Daily Mail</I> award for the most entertaining programme.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On sound radio the awards were as follows:&mdash; Personality of the Year, Gilbert Harding; Outstanding Actor, Howard Marion-Crawford; Outstanding Actress, Gladys Young; Most Popular Musical Entertainer, Tom Jenkins; Most Entertaining Programme, &ldquo;Educating Archie&rdquo;; Most Promising New Programme, &ldquo;The Al Read Show&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight&rsquo;s TV play was very good. It was &ldquo;Number Three&rdquo; by Charles Irving, a play about atom scientists and their reactions to the possible use of a terrible weapon which has been made as a result of their work. It packed plenty of suspense.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happened at school today. I came home with Kipper on the 1A &rsquo;bus.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did prep. all afternoon and went to the cinema this evening.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to the Robin Hood to see a domestic comedy &mdash; <I>Father&rsquo;s Doing Fine</I>, in Technicolor. The film, a very good one, was an adaptation of <I>Little Lambs Eat Ivy</I> by Noel Langley, so it was obviously a photographed stage play. Despite this, the film kept up a terrific pace throughout and the fun never flagged.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Lady Buckering (Heather Thatcher) has four daughters, three of whom get into trouble of some sort, while the other makes trouble for her husband (Richard Attenborough) when she is going to have a child. Susan Stephen, Virginia McKenna, Mary Germaine and Diane Hart were the respective daughters.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There were 3 films in all. &ldquo;Travel Royal&rdquo; was a documentary advertising Britain. The colour in this was breathtakingly lovely and the film was excellent. [The other film was <I><I>No Holds Barred</I></I> with the Bowery Boys&mdash;Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Marjorie Reynolds and Bernard Gorcey].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was late starting out today so I sprinted up to Shaftmoor Lane and just caught the S.B. I reckon I can cover the extra distance in faster time than the &rsquo;bus takes to get from the village to Olton Boulevard East.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had second period off. A special projection room is being built in the Large Lecture Room where we normally spend the period with Mr. Ballance.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 12.30 I held an extra parade for my platoon on the Science Court and put them through half an hour&rsquo;s drill for the Docker Cup [competition].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;From 10.30 until 11.0 we saw on TV part of the Windmill [Theatre]&rsquo;s twenty-first birthday party. [They have had one every year since it opened on February 4th 1932, and the theatre stayed open all through the War &mdash; &ldquo;We never closed&rdquo; is its slogan.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the artists who took part were Alfred Marks, Robert Moreton, Margot Holden and the inevitable Windmill Girls. No doubt some viewers were disappointed with what they saw, or rather, what they didn&rsquo;t see, but I quite enjoyed the show.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I was especially interested because Mam &amp; Dad gave me <I>Tonight and Every Night &mdash; The Windmill Story</I> by Vivian Van Damm for Christmas. It was published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co. Ltd. last year, and contains 206 pages and 39 photographs. Jean Kent, Beryl Orde, Eric Barker and Pearl Hackney, Richard Murdoch, Michael Howard, Harold Berens, Peter Sellers, Michael Bentine, Jimmy Edwards, Arthur English and many others all began their careers at the Windmill.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;One chapter &mdash; &ldquo;Ballet throughout Britain&rdquo; &mdash; explains how Mr. Van Damm (the owner-manager of the Windmill) and Mrs. Laura Henderson (who left it to him) were responsible for making British ballet truly national, taking it on tour, with Anton Dolin, Alicia Markova, Ninette de Valois, Constant Lambert all involved.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Sweet rationing ended today!]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Stephenson took us for Biology. We did one or two experiments with ground-up granite.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. we had the Docker Cup competition &mdash; the first since I have been an N.C.O. There was a separate competition for &ldquo;C&rdquo; Coy. Sgt. Fisk took charge of the platoon. I had nothing to do. The results aren&rsquo;t known yet.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I managed to get home from school by 1.15 today.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I cycled to Blues&rsquo; match versus Notts County. Mr. Webb had given me another complimentary ticket for Spion Kop. Birmingham won 3&ndash;2 though they hardly deserved to do so. Notts included five or six reserves and were twice on level terms. Murphy scored after 33 minutes (his 23rd goal this season), then Evans scored a minute from half-time. In the second half Trigg converted a penalty for hands, then Jackson scored. Finally, one minute from the end, Trigg scored a second penalty.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I went to the Library and got <I>The Complete Short Stories of Sherlock Holmes</I> [by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]. After I had taken Ginger out I went to bed and read.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was late for school this morning. There were three inches of snow on the ground and at the bottom of Park Vale, on the rugger pitch were some fifteen thrushes &mdash; most of them Redwings.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had a test in Chemistry. We are now studying soil with Mr. Stephenson in our plant ecology periods.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. we did mainly mapwork. The Docker Cup was won jointly by 4 and 5 Platoon; 10 Platoon won the Junior competition.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school the Music Circle met in Big School when Mr. Charles Perfect and Dr. Willis Grant played two of Mozart&rsquo;s Violin Concertos.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;An organ is being built into the New Music Room, so tomorrow&rsquo;s Shakespeare Society meeting will be held in Classical Corridor. We shall be in two groups &mdash; I am in Mr. Weatherall&rsquo;s and shall be reading the part of the Officer.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Last night I took Ginger out when I got back from school at 9.30, and had a great surprise when I met Bob [Vitoria] outside the Warwick cinema. I had no idea that he was in Birmingham, but apparently he left Bristol just over a week ago.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have spent almost every minute of today doing homework. While Mam and Dad were at the Mission, Granma came and she stayed to see &ldquo;What&rsquo;s My Line?&rdquo; and the play.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This edition of &ldquo;What&rsquo;s My Line?&rdquo; was one of the finest ever, mainly as a result of some brilliant fooling by Frankie Howerd who was the celebrity. He put on a false moustache and spectacles then for a full three minutes he goggled and fumed &mdash; a wonderful impersonation of Gilbert Harding which had everyone, save the blindfolded panel, in stitches.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On TV tonight I have watched C.H.O&rsquo;D. Alexander (O.E.) playing simultaneously sixteen games of chess. He won most of them too!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening we have listened to &ldquo;The Al Read Show&rdquo;, &ldquo;Radio Ruffles&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ray&rsquo;s a Laugh&rdquo;. At 9.25pm Dad and I watched Shirley Abicair on TV.

Mr. Stephenson had prepared some excellent illustrations for each of us and we were able to get a really good idea of the structure and formation of the Lickey Hills, and we did a bit of plant ecology too. We walked all the way from Rubery to Rednal, then had tea in the Bilberry Tearooms.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;For today I had organised a field meeting to the Bartley Green and Bittell Reservoirs. A dozen or more of us met outside Galloway&rsquo;s in Victoria Square, then we caught the 12 &rsquo;bus to Bartley Grn.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The first bird we saw was a Redshank (No. 15 for me) but there was little more on the reservoir. At Westminster Farm we saw plenty of Snipe but not the Water-Rail or Jack Snipe we had hoped for. We then walked to Northfield and caught the Rednal &rsquo;bus. We went all round the Bittell Reservoirs.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to see <I>Top Secret</I> at the R.H. [Robin Hood Cinema]. Geo. Cole plays a plumber, the inventor of a multi-flange fast flow filter, who is mistaken for an atom spy and captured by the Russians when he takes a holiday in France. The comedy was fast and furious and there was an amusing suggestion of Stalin in a scene at the Kremlin.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The other film was <I>Elstree Story</I> and contained many scenes from old films [including <I>Number Seventeen</I> (1932), <I>The White Sheik</I>, <I>Piccadilly</I> (1929), <I>Bulldog Drummond</I> (1929), <I>Arms and the Man</I> (1932), <I>The Informer</I> (1929), <I>Blossom Time</I> (1934) and <I>Poison Pen</I> (1939)].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the show has lost a little of the sparkle since it started from Coventry 18 months ago but I suppose that&rsquo;s inevitable. Reg Dixon (in the part written for Geo. Formby) was an entertainment in himself. Barbara Evans was a charming [space left] (she was at the Girls&rsquo; School till 1950!

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 8.0pm in the Home Service I listened to a most interesting talk by James Fisher on the effects of the recent floods on birds, animals and plants.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning we did not have our usual Chemistry test &mdash; we did Practical instead.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. we were given final details for next Friday&rsquo;s Field Day then I did some revision of map-reading with my platoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam and Dad have gone to the cinema this evening [to celebrate Dad&rsquo;s birthday. <I>Don&rsquo;t Bother to Knock</I> (A) with Richard Widmark, Marilyn Monroe and Anne Bancroft, and <I>A Millionaire for Christie</I> (U)] are on at the Warwick.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been writing up Biology notes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our double Biology period was spent in doing a test on Plant Ecology for Mr. Stephenson. I cycled to school so I got home for 1.5pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner Dad and I went on the &rsquo;bus to Blues 6th Round Cup match v Tottenham Hotspur. The attendance was 52,000. The teams were:&mdash; Blues: Merrick; Hall, Green; Bannister, Ferris, Boyd; Stewart, Purdon, Trigg, Warhurst, Wardle. &rsquo;Spurs: Ditchburn; Ramsey, Withers; Nicholson, Clarke, Burgess; Walters, Bennett, Duquemin, Baily, Medley.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The match was drawn 1&ndash;1. It was extremely hard fought and the tackling robust. Blues had more of the 1st half play and Wardle scored a wonderful 25 yard goal after 24 mins. After 60 mins. Purdon was injured, Blues cracked and &rsquo;Spurs took the upper hand, Bennett equalising from a header. Merrick made some magnificent saves.</P>

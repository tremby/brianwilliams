<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went down to Stratford Road to get another roll of wall-paper. Mr. Elwell did not have quite enough yesterday. He finished the papering today and then started on some painting.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I also went shopping with Mam before dinner &amp; I did more shopping during the afternoon on my bike. I finished reading today <I>Out with Romany by Moor and Dale</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I played football for half an hour in the park. Tomorrow afternoon I may be playing for a team, Robin Hood Jets &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know yet. I met their manager this evening.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened this morning but this afternoon I cycled to Shirley Park with &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; [Clive Rogers] and Brian [Holliday]. Robin Hood Jets were playing Olton Orient there. Brian was playing in goal for &ldquo;Jets&rdquo; &amp; Jack at left-half. I did not play until after the interval &amp; then at left-back, an unusual position [for me; I usually play left- or right wing].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At half-time we were losing 2&ndash;1 but afterwards Jack got a couple, putting us in the lead. Then two minutes from time Olton scored &amp; the result was 3&ndash;3. It was a pretty even game all through. Jets&rsquo; record is P5; W3; L1; D1; For25; Ag18.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight Bob &amp; I went to the Olton cinema to see <I>Tension</I> (A) and <I>&ldquo;The Marx Brothers at the Circus</I> (U) &mdash; a good programme.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up first this morning and took Mam and Dad a cup of tea in bed. Before breakfast I fetched my <I>M.M.</I> and <I>Listener</I>. Nest month B.O.P [<I>Boy&rsquo;s Own Paper</I>] will be 1/- instead of the usual 9d. This is due to the increased cost of newsprint.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent all morning reading. After dinner I played football in the park with &ldquo;Jack&rdquo;, Wilf [Rogers], Barry [Harvey] &amp; Ken [Gray], also Ken. Beddowes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I read <I>The Ship of Adventure</I> by Enid Blyton. I have now read the complete series [of &ldquo;Adventure&rdquo; books. I like the first one best, <I>The Island of Adventure</I>. The others are:&mdash; &ldquo;The Castle&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Valley&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Sea&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Mountain&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Ship&rdquo; &mdash; which I have just finished &mdash; and <I>The Circus of Adventure</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Elwell came this morning to whitewash what used to be the coal-house.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went down the village for Mam &amp; took Hound for a walk. We had dinner-tea at 3.45pm. I stayed in for the remainder of the afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening &ldquo;Jets&rdquo; held a practice in the park &amp; had sides. I played right wing for Mr. Cook&rsquo;s side. We had a very good game. My side won 5&ndash;4 &amp; I supplied at least three of the passes which got our goals.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I fetched the photographs which I took in Bude. All of them came out with the exception of the snap I took from the Breakwater. None were very good owing to the fact that the camera lets in light.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Later in the morning I went shopping with Mam. I stayed in for most of the afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I went to Cubs as usual. I had thought of having three or four sixes which could compete against each other both in games and packwork. Tonight Mr. Thornborough &amp; I put my idea into practice by appointing three probationary sixers. We have at least 25 cubs enrolled so another six needs forming.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today Mam took us to Dudley Zoo for the day. We met Mrs. Ashmore at Dudley at midday. Unfortunately it started to rain and the rain continued all afternoon. We enjoyed ourselves nevertheless. We saw penguins, raccoons, wolves, sloth bears and polar bears, leopards, cheetahs, yaks, kangaroos, deer, a camel, jackals, dingoes &amp; an elephant that played a mouth organ. There were also numerous birds &amp; parrots of many brilliant hues.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came away a little earlier than Mam [and Clarice and Julia] &amp; went to St. Andrews to see Blues draw 1&ndash;1 with Coventry. It was a tensely exiting [<I>sic</I>] game.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Clarice and Julia started back to school again this morning so I have spent the day at Hartfield Crescent. During the morning I cut up writing paper etc., with a guillotine cutter. In the afternoon I took the class (Mrs. Wright&rsquo;s) in reading and spelling.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I read part of <I>Out with Romany by Meadow and Stream</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went down the village with Ginger and then later I helped Mam with her shopping.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went to Hartfield Crescent and for the first part of the afternoon I did one or two odd jobs for Mrs. Wright. After this I read to Miss [F.E.] Brookes&rsquo; class until 4.30pm. It rained continually from about 3.30.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight after Mam &amp; Dad had gone to the cinema, I took Ginger for a walk to the park. She got a run at the same time. It was still drizzling.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I stayed in for part of the morning but also took Ginger for a walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I played outside-left for Robin Hood Jets in an away match with Shelford United &ldquo;B&rdquo; at Lyndon Park. We lost the toss &amp; had to kick uphill during the first half, which probably accounted for the fact that we resumed a goal down. We soon took the lead however, &amp; the final result was 4&ndash;2 in our favour. I had quite a good game.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I decided to go to the cinema so I went to the Warwick to see a Technicolor film entitled <I>It&rsquo;s a Great Feeling</I> (U) [with Jack Carson, Doris Day, Dennis Morgan, Errol Flynn, Danny Kaye, Patricia Neal, Ronald Reagan etc.] and a thrilling &ldquo;A&rdquo; film about bridge-building.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the afternoon I played football for a short time &amp; then Dad and I finished cutting the front lawn. With the very heavy rain we have had lately the lawns had not been cut since a month ago at least; consequently they are taking some effort.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I trimmed the edges of the front lawn, cut off all the seeds from the flowers &amp; tidied up the garden generally. Later in the evening I took Ginger for her evening walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I washed up &amp; listened to &ldquo;Mrs. Dale&rsquo;s Diary&rdquo; at 4.15pm. Unfortunately it rained on and off all the afternoon so I was unable to work in the garden.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I have been reading the newspapers and have listened to the radio for 30 minutes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has just been announced that Field Marshal Smuts died today at his home in Pretoria. He was 80 years of age &amp; only recently recovered from pneumonia.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got back it was time to go to Cubs. As usual I opened the clubroom [at Baker Street] and collected subs.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;For the first time this holiday I got up late &mdash; at 9.30am. I spent all morning cutting the back lawn with the shears. As Dad had sharpened them the job was not quite so tedious as it might have been.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We have had a terrific amount of rubbish to burn so I lit a couple of bonfires. The refuse was wet but with a little persuasion &amp; fanning I managed to make them burn.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went my favourite Coventry Road walk with Ginger. This time it took me 2&frac14; hours.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight Mam &amp; Dad have to the cinema [the Olton, to see Bernard Miles and Basil Rathbone in a comedy, <I>Chance of a Lifetime</I> (U), and Bill Elliott in <I>The Great Stagecoach Robbery</I> (U)]. I finished the lawn &amp; did blancoing.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a terrible crush to see which forms we were in this morning. Finally I found I was in Upper V.C.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our form-room is Room 19, just down the stairs from the Gym. It [used to be the Cleaners&rsquo; Room so] is just big enough to get in ten desks, and Mr. Whinnerah&rsquo;s desk. [He is our form-master and new to the school.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;How small the new boys look! I remember when I was a &ldquo;sherring&rdquo; [fresh herring] and thinking how big the fifth &amp; sixth formers were.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I have done prep. for over two hours, pressed my uniform and blancoed gaiters and belt.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday&rsquo;s blue moon caused no little disturbance &amp; anxious people inquired if it were the end of the world. Actually the moon appeared blue due to the fact that dust particles about 6&ndash;8 miles high diffracted the light rays. It is possible that the particles originated from forest fires in N. America. The sun was blue in E. Scot[land].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened this morning. In J.T.C. we had an inspection rehearsal as Field Marshal Montgomery is inspecting the C.C.F. tomorrow week.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon our House 2nd XV played its first game of the season versus Williams&rsquo;. I was hooker, my usual position. We lost 28&ndash;nil mainly because the forwards lacked any push in the scrum. The three-quarters weren&rsquo;t too good either.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I did homework and then took Ginger for her evening walk. As usual she did everything but annihilate three cats.</P>

<P>I had a bath before going to bed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We worked on our own in Physics this morning. At dinner time I played football.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In English we read Gray&rsquo;s <I>Elegy in a Country Churchyard</I>, and in French we had a debate on Saturday morning school. Nothing else happened. I got a haircut on my way home this afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I have done my prep. and also listened to &ldquo;Any Questions?&rdquo; on the radio. [It is Mam and Dad&rsquo;s 16th Wedding Anniversary.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had a bath before going to bed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I wrote to Mr. D.M. Sinclair, General Manger of the Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd. (&ldquo;Midland Red&rdquo;), to ask for the latest Fleet List, and the little red book, 5 &times; 3 7/8 inches, came yesterday, together with a fine colour map of &ldquo;Midland Red&rdquo; services.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The list, published last month, includes the latest 44-seat S.13 type single-decker buses. They are numbered 3877&ndash;3976 which corresponds to their registration numbers OHA 877&ndash;976. &ldquo;Midland Red&rdquo; buses always have a &ldquo;&mdash; HA&rdquo; registration, denoting Smethwick, as their headquarters are at Bearwood.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The map extends to Wrexham to the N.W., Nottingham to the N.E., Banbury to the S.E., and Gloucester to the S.W., and lists 13 connecting bus companies. They include Barton, Bristol, City of Oxford, Crosville, East Midland, Eastern National, Lincolnshire, Midland General, Potteries, Red &amp; White, Stratford Blue, Trent, and United Counties.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened at school this morning. This afternoon I stayed in most of the afternoon [<I>sic</I>] and listened to a football commentary on the radio.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I went to a Birmingham Youth for Christ Rally at the Town Hall. It was a most enjoyable evening. Bryan S.W. Green, Rector of Birmingham, was the guest speaker &amp; Madeleine Hickman was the Soloist. The rest of the music came from the Sparkhill Citadel [Salvation Army] Band and Songsters.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight the last trams are running on the Alum Rock, Washwood Heath and Lozells routes, being replaced by buses tomorrow. The Washwood Heath trams are going to Selly Oak &amp; will not be scrapped yet. [The photo is of No.841, introduced in March 1929. It has a Short Bros body, M&amp;G bogies and two 60 h.p. motors.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning the weather was drizzly and while Mam, Grandad and Clarice and Julia sat in a shelter on the sea-front, Dad and I walked to Westbrook and Westgate. At Westbrook is the Royal Sea Bathing Hospital built in 1790. There is also a big pavilion where a resident concert party is engaged. There is seating for 1,500. St. Mildred&rsquo;s Bay &amp; West Bay make up the Westgate coast. On the cliff tops are beautifully kept lawns &amp; flower beds and here also is a large pavilion.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The weather cleared up in the afternoon and we bathed in the pool again.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening we sat on the beach while Clarice &amp; Julia went to the Punch and Judy. They hardly even miss a performance and often appear in the show. Before going home, we had some chips for our supper.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast this morning Dad and I went to the station to see about the luggage. It was only then that we found that we had been given back wrong halves to our return tickets. However, we got the right halves back. Back on the beach, we went into the pool. It was very hot.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner, we bathed again and then lay on the beach in the hot sun. I like getting sunburned since one only gets the chance at holiday time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight we went to a firework display in the Dreamland Car Park. This was really very good for apart from the usual Sky Rockets and Comets and Fountains etc., we saw the Star of India, a Circus Clown, a Goose that laid a Golden Egg and a house on fire with a fire engine &amp; firemen with a hose &mdash; all made of fireworks.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Again it was very hot today and we bathed both in the morning and afternoon. I can now swim by myself.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea we did a little shopping and then went along to a shelter by the Sun Deck Pavilion and we stayed there until about 8.45pm. Clarice and Julia went along to see Punch and Judy. I must say that this is the best show that I&rsquo;ve seen of its kind. It always has four to five hundred people at each of its three daily performances.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After sitting in the shelter we walked back along the sea-front and Dad and I walked along the pier. It was dark by then and we could see right along the coast, hundreds of twinkling lights. It looked really beautiful.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had some chips for our supper and got to bed at about 10.30.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was out this morning by 7.0am. The sun was shining and it was nice to think that instead of going home there was still a little longer for us to remain by the seaside. Already, hundreds of people were pouring into the town. After breakfast we said goodbye to Mr. and Mrs. Merchant.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When we got down to the beach the Bathing Pool had been drained and we did not bathe until this afternoon. The early promise of good weather was not fulfilled: it was cloudy this morning and rained on and off after dinner.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening we sat in the usual shelter and then walked to the Harbour. We had some whelks and then chips before going home to bed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today, our last full day here, the weather has been colder and cloudy. In fact, rain this afternoon sent the few people on the beach scattering for shelter under the Pavilion, hastily scooping up deckchairs which here cost 6d per session!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad and I swam in the pool during the morning and afternoon, and at my suggestion since it would be our last chance this holiday, again tonight.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had some chips for supper and got in for 9.0pm because the trunk had still to be packed. It is to be collected next Tuesday.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems quite strange writing in my diary again. [On holiday I had been writing on rough paper.] I got up early this morning and had a last walk along the beach. Breakfast was at 7.45 and we were on the station in good time to catch the 9.18 train. We all got seats this time. As the train drew out, we all looked back, rather regretfully, at the house which had been our home. The journey itself was uneventful. We made thirteen stops totalling an hour and a quarter and arrived in Birmingham at 3.57. The journey took 399 minutes in all. Birmingham was just as we left it. It was raining as hard as ever; what a Bank Holiday! [Years later, August Bank Holiday will be moved to the end of the month. The weather will be no better!]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;One of my goldfish was dead when we got home. Tonight we saw Part 5 of the &ldquo;Passing Show&rdquo; on T.V. I now have the task of writing up nine days&rsquo; diary.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent some of this morning writing up last week&rsquo;s events. I cycled to Stratford Road just before 10am and got some meat for Ginger. The demonstration film on this morning was last Sunday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Weekly Review&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I looked at my picture postcards. I now have over a hundred [and still have them 50 years later]. Mr. Burton brought Ginger back at about 3.0pm. She is in season again.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 5.0pm I went to the Hippodrome. The Folies-Berg&egrave;re Revue (<I>C&rsquo;est de la folie</I>) is there until Saturday when it will have completed a fortnight&rsquo;s run. The show is direct from London Hippodrome where it ran for two years and also the Paris Folies-Berg&egrave;re theatre. It has been described as the most sensational and spectacular show ever. The first act was in two parts (a) <I>Les &Eacute;toiles de Paris</I> was very spectacular and colourful with Mlle. Angela, Kenneth Birrell and Vilma la Verne, les Boys, les Mod&egrave;les, les Danseuses and Les Nus. (b) was &ldquo;A Man about Town&rdquo;, a sketch with Alec Pleon. He ended up by (accidentally?) knocking over the scenery. Kenneth Birrell and a Vocal Ensemble featured in <I>Les Chasseurs</I>. The third item was &ldquo;Place Pigalle&rdquo; with Vilma la Verne singing with Eddie Vitch, Les Boys and Les Girls. The fourth scene showed the reception given to mark the debut of a man whose music was destined to become immortal &mdash; Frederic Chopin. Next we saw some really delightful juggling by Vivian et Tassi followed by <I>L&rsquo;enfer des Femmes</I>. Rixio was the Devil, and Angela played Purity. Les Danseuses took the part of the sinners, Les Nus the part of the Temptress. Then after Alec Pleon again we saw <I>Le Masque de Versailles</I> (a) the Boudoir (b) the Fountains with Les Mod&egrave;les et Les Nus.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After the Intermission was <I>Premier Bal</I> with Les Mod&egrave;les, Les Danseuses et Les Nus. Eddie Vitch then showed us &ldquo;How to behave in a smart Parisienne Restaurante&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t very funny, This was followed by <I>Le Grande Catherine</I> then &ldquo;Boy meets Girl&rdquo; with Vilma la Verne and les Mod&egrave;les. The 13th scene was <I>Retour &agrave; Paris</I> then Les Trois de Milles &mdash; stalwart exemplars of muscular eurythmy. This was followed by <I>Ivories de Chine</I> wit its masked figures. This was in two parts (a) The Market Place, Pekin (b) The Grand Palace. Alec Pleon sang and the show ended with the whole company in a grand finale.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today Warwickshire started their match against South Africa at the County Ground. I arrived at the ground at 9.30 and got in at 11.10. Dudley Nourse won the toss and put Warwick in to bat on a drying wicket. cricket</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Gardner and Don Taylor batted steadily for twenty minutes and added 14 before the former was caught by Athol Rowan off Melle for 7. Ord started off very unsteadily but took his score to 23 before being caught by McLean off A. Rowan at 12.47. Hitchcock batted brightly and his fourth scoring stroke was a six off Mansell but he also fell to Rowan&rsquo;s leg trap, being caught by McLean for 23. The score was then 118 for 3. The wicket had cut up very badly. Dollery was the next partner to Don Taylor but Taylor himself was caught by McLean off Mann with the score at 134. His 73 took two hours and included 8 fours. Wolton&rsquo;s 27 included two fours and a six. He was another Rowan victim at 179. In the next 15 minutes E.B. Lewis and Townsend lost their wickets for two apiece. No. 9 in the batting order was Keith Dollery, a young fast bowler from Tasmania, playing his first game for Warwick. He scored 14 but was caught by Eric Rowan off Athol Rowan with the score at 213. Grove was out with no addition to the score. Then Tom Dollery hit out, a four, a single, and then two huge successive sixes to the leg boundary off Athol Rowan. Van Ryneveld, a magnificent fielder, made a tremendous dive to catch the second of these and only just failed to do so. The next ball clouted by Dollery was also going for six but McLean thought otherwise and took a fine boundary catch. Warwick were all out for 230 &mdash; a good score considering the state of the wicket. Dollery had contributed 52. Twenty-eight of his last twenty-nine runs came in boundaries.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The day&rsquo;s excitement was by no means over. Rowan was brilliantly run out by Weeks with the score at 4. Then Waite fell to Grove two minutes later &mdash; 8 for 2. McLean was bowled by Keith Dollery just after the same player had held a smart return catch off Van Ryneveld&rsquo;s bat &mdash; 10 runs for 4 wickets after only a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s play. Then Cheetham came in to steady the batting but Nourse and then Mansell fell to smart catches in the slips off Weeks&rsquo; bowling &mdash; 26 for 6. Cheetham batted for nearly an hour for 19 runs. He was caught by Townsend off Weeks with the score at 37. Athol Rowan was caught by Townsend off Grove at 39. Mann and Chubb stayed together at the wicket for the remaining 40 minutes. At the close, S.A. were 67 for 8 wickets.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened today. I stayed in during the morning. We had dinner early, intending to go to Lewis&rsquo;s Flower Show with Grandad. We went down to Grandad&rsquo;s but he did not want to go particularly so we stayed at his house for the afternoon. We got back just after 6.30.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On T.V. this evening we saw &ldquo;The Silent Village&rdquo;, a new play by William Templeton. A runaway wife meets her lover in an inn on a Swiss mountainside. Everything is completely in order; there is even a chicken ready for supper in the kitchen. Yet the inn is deserted. Other travellers arrive &mdash; the pursuing husband, an English family, a boxer in training and a composer. But there is not a soul in the village. An avalanche is about to wipe out the village ... The night is spent in apprehension, and throughout a tense atmosphere is created, an adroit suspense right up to the last moment.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened all day. Warwickshire&rsquo;s match against the South Africans ended in a draw. S.A. were all out for 77 in their first innings (Chubb 24 n.o., Grove 4 for 30, Weeks 3 for 23, Dollery (K) 2 for 19). Warwickshire did not enforce the follow-on and added a further 201 for 7 dec. (Don Taylor 69, Chubb 3 for 87). This left S.A. to make 355 runs to win at the rate of seventy runs an hour. They made 290 for 6. Glamorgan are the only county side to beat the tourists so far. cricket</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On T.V. tonight, I saw the Newsreel, &ldquo;Looking at Animals&rdquo; (heads), &ldquo;The Duchess Vanished&rdquo;, then Arthur Askey [whom I met a year or two earlier, together with his daughter Anthea]. Lastly I saw the first of four films on life in the British Isles &mdash; &ldquo;We in Britain&rdquo;.</P>

This was the story of a P.O.W. at Marlag in the late summer of 1944. &ldquo;Albert&rdquo; was a life-like dummy, capable of marching and smoking and so forth, an escape device which was the handiwork of Lieut. John Worsley, R.N.V.R. The play was very good and the atmosphere never lacked reality. Michael Gough gave a fine performance as Geoffrey Ainsworth, the bearded creator of &ldquo;Albert&rdquo; as did Felix King as the Kommandant.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Following May&rsquo;s dismissal before lunch, Compton and Watson put on 40 for the 4th wicket. Watson was brilliantly run out by McCarthy and then wickets fell cheaply. Compton, last man out, scored 73 of England&rsquo;s 194. Watson, 41, was the next highest scorer. cricket</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The main point of interest was, for me, Worcestershire&rsquo;s match against Yorkshire, and since Yorkshire lost by 8 runs Warwickshire have won the County Championship for the first time since 1911. They have only been beaten once &mdash; by Lancashire &mdash; and won the Championship with only 13 players, not one of whom was called upon to play for England. 5 players scored 1,000 runs while Hollies and Grove (for the first time) took 100 wickets.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Later I watched the Weekly Review on T.V. This is part of the daily demonstration at 11.0am.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After this, I read today&rsquo;s <I>Wizard</I> and <I>Adventure</I>. [They were published on Tuesdays, and the <I>Rover</I> and <I>Hotspur</I> on Thursdays, 2d each, by D.C. Thomson &amp; Co Ltd.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I received a postcard of Windsor Castle this morning. It was written by Kipper, who is staying at 22 Northwood Avenue, Purley, Surrey. He says:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dear Willie,
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We&rsquo;re having a glorious time here in London &mdash; the South Bank is as good as they say. The Festival Gardens &amp; funfair are lovely at night time, when they are lit up. We have also booked for the Festival Hall twice during our week&rsquo;s stay. Phil got us all down here safely on Thursday: 134 miles in 5 hours. I hope we get back as well! Please remember me to your parents. Cheerio for now,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Kipper.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We stayed in Windsor for an hour on the way down &amp; went around the college.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We saw two films on T.V. this afternoon. The first showed a party of men climb the Eiffel Tower from the outside. The second was &ldquo;Hayfoot&rdquo; a comedy with William Tracey and Joe Sawyer in the same series as &ldquo;About Face&rdquo; which we saw on July 25th.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I went to Cubs. Only six turned up so we played cricket. It seems to me that a lot of Cubs think that a holiday from school automatically entails a holiday from Cubs! A lot of boys are away with their parents though.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I took Ginger for her evening walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went shopping down the village with Mam. Ginger came with us.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon we all went by &rsquo;bus [ ... ] to Heybarnes Recreation Ground which is, of course, the home of the recently innovated Rotorstation. [We went on the Outer Circle 11 to The Swan, then had our first ride on a Coventry Road bus, the trolley buses having finished on June 30th. The new services are the 57B, 58 and 60.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The helicopters make two or three daily trips to and from London. We saw one leave at 4.0pm, and then we went to Granma&rsquo;s [236 Millhouse Road] and stayed until 5.0 o&rsquo;clock. She was pleased to see us. We walked all the way home.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I took Ginger for a walk tonight. We watched &ldquo;What&rsquo;s My Line?&rdquo; on T.V.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning we all went to the Rotorstation and saw two helicopters leave at 11.0am. They are most fascinating to watch. I took some photographs,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We dropped in at Granma&rsquo;s and she insisted on our staying to dinner. We did so, and Mam and I did the washing up afterwards.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We left at 2.30 or a little after and saw the helicopter land half an hour later. We walked as far as &ldquo;The Swan&rdquo; [Yardley] and then caught the No. 11 &rsquo;bus. We got home at 4.15.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We watched a play on &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Hour&rdquo;. It was &ldquo;Caliph for a Day&rdquo; by Rex Tucker, an Arabian Nights Tale.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ginger was very tired tonight &amp; would only let me take her to Starcross Road and back for her walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We did not watch the T.V. tonight except for the weather maps. We listened instead to &ldquo;Meet Christopher Blaze&rdquo; and Derek Roy in &ldquo;Happy Go Lucky&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning nothing much happened. I went down the village and took Ginger out.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon we watched the composite Newsreel at 3.0pm and &ldquo;The Squirrel, the Hare, and the Little Grey Rabbit&rdquo; at 5.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight Mam and Dad went to the cinema as usual. On T.V. I watched a visit to the Reptile House and Aquarium at the London Zoo &ldquo;to meet some cold-blooded animals on a warm summer evening&rdquo;! It was a very interesting visit though and most enjoyable. At 8.45 there was &ldquo;Caribbean Cabaret&rdquo; featuring the Trinidad All-Steel Percussion Orchestra. Then at 9.45 the cameras paid a visit to the Tower of London to see the Yeoman Gaoler perform the Ceremony of the Keys. A final item was a &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; interview with Sam Rocket, a Channel Swimming coach.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I cycled down to the village to do some shopping.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I spent the afternoon listening to various commentaries on Warwickshire&rsquo;s last home game against Hampshire. Warwickshire batted first and made 344 for 6. Dollery is 110 not out. Spooner made 73, Townsend 56. The game was interrupted once or twice by rain. cricket</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I also saw another T.V. Programme from London Zoo from 3.30 until 4.9pm. I think myself that the impromptu entertainment given us by the chimps etc., compares favourably with quite a lot of the stuff professional artists provide. These visits to the zoo are well worth while.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;B&rsquo;ham lost 4&ndash;nil to Leicester! I lit a bonfire at 4.15 and it kept alight even though the rain fell very heavily tonight. On T.V. we watched Part 1 of <I>Treasure Island</I>. weather</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up this morning and made the tea, then took Ginger out.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened during the morning and afternoon. It rained off and on &mdash; mainly on.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Granma came this evening after tea and we all watched &ldquo;Claudine&rdquo; [<I>sic</I>], a play by Rose Franken. Anne Walford was very convincing as Claudia [<I>sic</I>] but Patrick Barr also gave a lively performance as the husband. On the whole, the play was pleasingly produced.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We got up this morning at about ten o&rsquo;clock and after breakfast we went shopping in the village. I expected to hear my G.C.E. results from the Northern Universities Board on the 11th but I did not. I called at the Martins&rsquo; and found that Kipper and Phil heard their results from school a fortnight ago. The results were published in the <I>Birmingham Post</I> on the 17th and Phil showed me a copy. I found I had passed in all four subjects. Kipper passed in French, Maths, General Science, English Language and Geography. John passed in French.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Chadwin got a pass in English and Maths as did Durnell. Hollingworth and Clasper passed in English alone. The failure to show individual merit is, in my opinion, quite ridiculous.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the evening&rsquo;s T.V. programmes was a visit to Southend-on-Sea to see the Illuminations. The programme can only be described as a failure.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning we went to town at about 11.0am. We went first to Mark&rsquo;s and Spencer&rsquo;s then C &amp; A, Lewis&rsquo;s and the Midland Educational. At Lewis&rsquo;s we went on the roof, a hundred and five feet above street level. We got home at 4.15.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to the Hippodrome this evening. First on the bill were Bebe and Belle, two dancers, then Carl Carlisle &amp; Maisie Weldon &mdash; impressionists. Next came the two Arvings &mdash; two very good continental cyclists, Harry Bailey the &ldquo;King of Blarney&rdquo; &amp; Vic and Joe Crastomian. After the interval we saw Bebe and Belle, Donald B. Stuart a conjuror, and Jackie a clever Balancer. Topping the bill was the American Strip-Tease Girl Gypsy Rose Lee. She took five minutes to undress (finishing the operation as a shadow-graph), She introduced her four &ldquo;beauties&rdquo; sparsely covered with &ldquo;vegetation&rdquo; and clothed them, giving a mock lecture at the same time, a slightly disappointing act.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went to the Library and got myself a Peter Cheyney novel &mdash; <I>Lady Behave!</I> I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to read more than a couple of pages today.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon&rsquo;s television programmes consisted of three films, one about model aeroplanes, and a film about the Royal Navy as well as one of the &ldquo;Holiday in Paris&rdquo; series.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a very good Music Hall show tonight &ldquo;First Night&rdquo;, the first T.V. show from the Radio Exhibition at Earl&rsquo;s Court. It included Terry-Thomas, Anne Ziegler and Webster Booth and Rawicz and Landaur. Terry-Thomas gave an excellent one man parody of the &ldquo;Housewives&rsquo; Choice&rdquo; records programme. It was great fun.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It rained continually all morning and afternoon. I doubt whether I have ever seen such heavy rain. weather</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam bought me my Birthday present from the Midland Educational &mdash; a Bible published by Collins with sixteen photogravure illustrations of Holy Land scenes. It has a leather cover and also contains pronunciation notes. [I used it for many years and still have it.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We got home at 5.45.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Grace came this evening to see the repeat performance of &ldquo;Claudia&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had a letter from the B.B.C. today offering me a preliminary interview with Miss Doreen Dixon in connection with Television Drama Productions next time I&rsquo;m in London.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning, I cycled to Stoney Lane to get some horse-meat for Ginger. Then I watched the T.V. Demonstration Film. It rained heavily at intervals. I went to Dorling&rsquo;s and fetched <I>B.O.P.</I> and <I>The Listener</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I washed up and went shopping on my cycle. I cycled to Granma&rsquo;s at 5.0pm. I had to collect some beetroot for Dad to enter in the B.S.A. Third Annual Show tomorrow.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I watched the T.V. while Mam and Dad were at the cinema. There was the Newsreel then a half hour of music provided by Paul Adam, followed by the first of a new series of &ldquo;In the News&rdquo;. &ldquo;Starlight&rdquo; at 9.15 featured the Mack Triplets from America. Finally there was a visit to the London International Patrol Camp at Gilwell Park for the last Camp Fire. Most outside broadcasts are very good. This was no exception. Scouts</P>

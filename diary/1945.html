<H2>Russia &mdash; a funny feeling
</H2>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to Cubs with Barry. Mr. Harvey presented me with a book. Inside it says today&rsquo;s date and underneath &ldquo;Presented to Cub B.&nbsp;Williams, for good service, H.&nbsp;Harvey G.S.M.&rdquo; The title is <I>Timur&rsquo;s Vow</I>, and on the paper cover [dust-wrapper] is a boy holding a white flag with a red star, with a tank in the background. There are many black and white pictures too. It is a Russian book [adapted by Nora Lloyd and Musia Renbourn from the film by A. Gaidar, and illustrated by Donia Nachshen]. It seems to be about the War and it gives me a funny feeling. I don&rsquo;t like it very much. I wish I could have had a nature book instead, like my <I>Birds of the Village</I> Puffin picture book by James Fisher, which is my favourite.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Russia is the largest country in the world and it is called Noyta. I have got 33 Russian stamps in my stamp album but they also give me a funny feeling. They say &ldquo;PYCCKAR NOYTA&rdquo; but the R is the wrong way round. There are also other different letters. Most of the stamps do not have perforations. Russia is ruled by Marshall Stalin but I don&rsquo;t like him very much. I like Mr. Churchill but people say he is a warmonger. President Roosevelt is all right.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have got my report from school. I am Very Good at Arithmetic, Arithmetic (Oral), English, Composition, History and Geography, and Excellent at Reading and Writing. Position in Class 1st, Number in Class 51. Mrs. Wright says, &ldquo;I am very pleased indeed with Brian&rsquo;s attitude to his work &amp; his results. He should do well.&rdquo; Mrs. Wright has signed her name underneath but written &ldquo;A. Whight&rdquo; and changed the h to an r. Mr. Olarenshaw has signed it with his purple rubber stamp.

<P>I went to school and told Mrs. Wright that today is the 12th of March 1945 so can we write it 12.3.45 in our books? She said yes. I came home with Peter Cook, whose father is a teacher at Hartfield Crescent Senior Boys School, and told him about the date. He had not noticed it. While I was playing with Peter, Mr. Cook came and showed us the <I>Birmingham Mail</I> which said that today was 12345. There will never be another day like this for a hundred years, except the 23rd of April 1956.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have had a lot of Christmas present and Clarice and Julia have also. I have got <I>Film Pictorial Annual 1939</I>, which is full of beautiful film star pictures and articles.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad and I went to St. Andrews this morning to see Blues play Leicester City. We went in at the Cattell Road entrance instead of Garrison Lane. I have not been in the Spion Cop stand before. It was very good as we were by the half-way line. Blues won 6&ndash;2. Wilson Jones scored twice, Dougall, Bodle, Edwards and Mulraney got the others.</P>

<H2>Numerology</H2>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today is Boxing Day and I have been reading my <I>Film Pictorial Annual 1939.</I> There are pictures and stories of <I>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</I>, <I>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</I>, <I>Young and Innocent</I> and other films and articles. There is also a very interesting article called &ldquo;Numbers Rule Your Life.&rdquo; I have worked out that my birth number is 11 and my name number is 11. It is called Numerology. I am very interested in numbers.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Blues were playing Leicester City again today and won 1&ndash;nil.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up first this morning and before breakfast Clarice and Julia and I took Ginger for a run in the park.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Later in the morning I went round to Dorling&rsquo;s to get this week&rsquo;s <I>Listener</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent the rest of the day doing Revision except for a short period in the evening when I cut the lawn and took Ginger out.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea we all went for a walk to Coventry Road taking Ginger with us. The new &rsquo;buses were running. They are numbered, I believe, between 2626 and 2655 but the design is the same.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. R. Cook took us for French. This evening I played outside for some time and took Ginger for her evening walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got back I blancoed my belt and gaiters and polished brasses and cap badge.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;From 9.30 until 11.30 we had the third of the Maths papers.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I paraded today for the first time for five weeks. We had a rehearsal for the Inspection which takes place on July 13th. J.T.C.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I played for the 3rd XI v Porter&rsquo;s on Park Vale Pitch. I won the toss and put Porter&rsquo;s in to bat. Then Bottomley and I opened the bowling and Bottomley soon had a couple of wickets and took, altogether, 5 wkts. for 39 runs in 14 overs. We bowled throughout the innings. I clean bowled three batsmen for 28 runs in 11 overs, two of them maidens. Two catches were grounded and FIVE other catches were missed, the fielding was so poor. Porter&rsquo;s ran up 101 for 9 dec. but should only have scored about 50 at the most. We were all out for 45. (Bottomley 19) I got a &ldquo;duck&rdquo; again.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got home by 5.0pm. I was on my bike as usual but I did not cycle yesterday.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I went to the Library and later I took Ginger out. Mam and Dad are at the cinema.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After a very nice tea, we all went in the car to play cricket at Solihull Park until 8.30. We each batted three times and I hit the stumps three times (and my own twice).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After supper, we played one or two word games. I got home for eleven o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Physics, the period was in Room 57, we started Sound, while in English we started to read a play, or rather a series of scenes, about Parliamentary procedure. It is &ldquo;Pageant of Parliament&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Dramatic Civics&rdquo; Series.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to Choir Practice as usual after morning school. This week in Maths we are doing Stocks and Shares. We went outside to play basketball in Gym but it soon rained and we had to come indoors.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I went to Cubs, then took Ginger out when I got back. Then at 9.30pm., Mam, Dad and I listened to what has been described as the fight of the century &mdash; that for the Middle Weight Championship of the World between Sugar Ray Robinson (U.S.A.) and Randolph Turpin (G.B.).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Turpin won on points with some very fine boxing, his main &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; being the straight left. Never once in the whole enthralling hour did the fabulous &ldquo;Sugar&rdquo; dominate the scene. According to the <I>[Birmingham] Gazette</I>, Turpin won twelve clear rounds with a division of spoils in rounds six, ten and eleven.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;For second period today, Dr. Willis Grant held a choir practise [<I>sic</I>] in the Music Room.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Break was immediately after second period so that the C.C.F. [Combined Cadet Force] could hold a full scale inspection rehearsal. After this we marched up University Road to do a platoon attack.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was picked for the 2nd XI to play against Burgess&rsquo;s this afternoon but our opponents were unable to field a team so we won by default.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I called at Bob&rsquo;s office in town on the way home but he was out at the time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the afternoon I cleaned out my aquarium.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Annual Inspection was held on the South Field this afternoon at 1.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Inspecting Officer was Vice Admiral Sir H.W.V. McCall. After the inspection, the platoon did its attack, then at 3.40 the Vice Admiral addressed us for ten minutes in Big School.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 4 o&rsquo;clock I went to the Medical Room to choose my book prize but I could not see one that I really wanted. So I shall have a 15/- book token and choose my own book or books.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town and called to see Bob.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I spent doing some homework then this afternoon I helped Dad and two friends [Don and Ron] to install our new television set. It has an indoor aerial which had to be put in the loft.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had the set on for the first time at 5.40 and we saw part of a &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Hour&rdquo; play &ldquo;Where Love Is&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The next programmes began at 8 o&rsquo;clock. First there was a fifteen minute &ldquo;Weekly Review&rdquo; recalling events from last week&rsquo;s newsreels, then a short film entitled &ldquo;British Steel&rdquo;. There was a play, &ldquo;The Debutante&rsquo;s Father&rdquo; from 8.25 until 9,55. It wasn&rsquo;t too bad and actually humorous in parts, but at times it tended to drag.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There was no choir practice at 12.30 but we did have one in the afternoon from 2.25 to 3.45pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the S.B. and then watched the T.V. Children&rsquo;s Hour. I saw the film <I>Ninety Degrees South</I>, H.G. Ponting&rsquo;s film of Scott&rsquo;s epic journey to the South Pole. It was most instructive.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After this evening&rsquo;s Newsreel there was &ldquo;Country Dish&rdquo; in which Philip Harben made Syllabub. After &ldquo;Men o&rsquo; Brass&rdquo; with a brass band, came &ldquo;What&rsquo;s My Line?&rdquo; There was then a visit to the South Bank at dusk to see some of the lights but this was rather disappointing.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The choir, orchestra and soloists had a full rehearsal. This evening I cycled and got there on time at 6.0pm. I got home by 8.45 and saw part of &ldquo;The Passing Show&rdquo;, part 4 on T.V.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon&rsquo;s programmes were quite good. At 3.0 Richard Hughes read his own short story &mdash; &ldquo;The Overcoat&rdquo; which was jolly good, then there was a C.O.I. film &ldquo;Working in a Store&rdquo; and a book review at 3.30.</P>

I spent the next two periods watching the competition. J.R. Luckett won and D.H. Benson and B.J. Pierce were equal second.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. we cleaned rifles. I played this afternoon for the 3rd XI v Dunt&rsquo;s in the Losers&rsquo; Final, at Eastern Road. We batted first and scored 107 (R.H. Moore 40, I got 1 not out) and we soon had five wickets down very cheaply; but there was a big stand which we could not break and the game petered out as a draw. R.V.B. Smith got 33 n.o. with Dunt&rsquo;s score at 79 for 6. I bowled four overs, two maidens, took 0 for five.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;House Meetings were held until 10.10am when we went to form rooms except for the Choir which had to rehearse in the break. After break we went up to Edgbaston Old Church.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;For first period this afternoon, I helped Mr. Cooke with a lot of books. There was a Julian Horner Concert at 2.30. Dobson and Young have an extremely interesting and amusing lecture.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today was Speech Day. It was held at 11.15am. First came some prize recitations and the Head&rsquo;s report. The Head criticised the Comprehensive School Scheme. He said that so far from breaking down class distinction, the scheme in large cities would merely congeal the existing characteristics of the immediate neighbourhood which could scarcely be described as equality of opportunity. The Bailiff (Prof. Oliver Thomson) then presented the prizes and spoke and the Head presented the Bache Memorial Cup to J. Hutchings and Dale Memorial Medals to J.M.S. Arnott and P. Westbrook. The Vice Captain [G.T. Lyall] proposed a vote of thanks and the ceremony ended with the School Song.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;School played Old Eds. this afternoon. I took Clarice &amp; Julia. The match was drawn. Old Eds. 196, School 177 for 8. There was a free tea.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I bought a copy of the <I>Sports Argus Football Annual</I> this morning, and I also received by post, a free advance copy of the August edition of <I>Readers Digest</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Burton called this morning to collect Ginger. She is going to stay at his farm for a week while we are on holiday. She seemed very pleased to see Mr. Burton but I&rsquo;m not so sure whether she&rsquo;s so pleased now. [Mr. Burton gave us Ginger when she was eleven months old and not expected to be up to racing standard.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast we all went to town. I exchanged my 15/- Book Token at the Midland Educational for <I>Birds of the Wayside and Woodland</I> (10/-) and <I>The Nature of the Universe</I> by Fred Hoyle (5/-). The former book, edited by Enid Blyton is based upon T.A. Coward&rsquo;s standard work. The latter is the book of Hoyle&rsquo;s B.B.C. talks [which I read in <I>The Listener</I>. The book was published only in April last year but has become so popular that my copy is the 9th impression.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I saw that Ivor Novello&rsquo;s <I>Glamorous Night</I> is coming to the Theatre Royal next week as an ice show. I can&rsquo;t go because we are going to Margate the day after tomorrow, but I got an advert for it. It is quite expensive, the Stalls seats range from 5/6 to 8/6, and it is 2/6 in the balcony.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We got home by half past one. This afternoon I mended a puncture and cut some of the lawn.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing else happened.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I got a haircut in the village and bought some new straw for Ginger&rsquo;s bed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After that I went down to the park to get some new pond weed. I planted this in the aquarium after dinner. I am putting the goldfish in the bath while we are away.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 3.0pm I watched the composite edition Newsreel on T.V.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Later I twice went to the Library. Mam &amp; Dad are now at the cinema.</P>

<H4>Korean Diary for July 18th&ndash;24th

<P>19th. Mr. Acheson rejects Communist proposal for withdrawl [<I>sic</I>] of foreign troops from Korea on conclusion of an armistice.</P>

<h3>SATURDAY 28th JULY
</h3>
<table width="750" border=0><tr valign="top">
   <td width=550 valign="top">

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Off to Margate! The weather looked promising apart from the rain and that was coming down in buckets. The 31A &rsquo;bus took thirty-eight minutes to get to Grey&rsquo;s [in Bull Street]. Then we waited on Platform 12 of Snow Hill Station for the 10.10am train. There was a terrific rush and we couldn&rsquo;t get on it. Instead we caught the 10.20 from Platform 7. I didn&rsquo;t get a seat on that &amp; had to sit on a suitcase in the corridor with a few hundred other people.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There is always a great thrill when the train at last draws out of the station. It was especially thrilling because we were soon racing through our own stations, Tyseley, Acocks Green and Olton. The first stop was made at Warwick and we made at least fifteen more stops. Outside Leamington the rain gave way to sunshine and the sun shone for the rest of the day. It was unbearably hot. We got our first glimpse of the sea between Minster and Ramsgate. We got into Margate at 5.25; the journey had taken seven hours.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The station was only a few hundred yards from the sea front and Grosvenor Place a few minutes walk away. The &ldquo;Moranna&rdquo; is only two or three minutes walk from the sea. After a wash, we had tea at 6.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandad has a tiny room to himself, the rest of us share a front bedroom. There are three meals a day but no supper. After tea we walked down to the beach. The tide was in so we paddled. The beach is sandy and there is a line of sea-weed where the tide reaches its highest point.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Margate has its own harbour alongside the pier and jetty to the east of the clock tower. At night the whole of the front is illuminated and the lights look really lovely.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;One thing that I did notice is that there appears to be only small numbers of sea-gulls here. Most of them are Black-Headed Gulls; there are a few Herring Gulls too. None of them will allow anyone near. They are very timid yet at Aberystwyth they will take food from one&rsquo;s hand.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Before going back to our lodgings, we walked through &ldquo;Dreamland&rdquo;, a 15 acre amusement park, very much like Blackpool&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pleasure Beach&rdquo;. This too is quite enchanting when lit up at night.</P>

<h3>SUNDAY 29th JULY
</h3>
<table width="750" border=0><tr valign="top">
   <td width=550 valign="top">

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Breakfast this morning was at 9am instead of the usual 8.30. Staying at the &ldquo;Moranna&rdquo; with us are a Mr. and Mrs. Merchant from West Bromwich, Mr. and Mrs. Gray from Harrow and Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd from Bordesley Green East.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We all spent the morning on the beach but it wasn&rsquo;t very warm at all. The beach was quite crowded though.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the afternoon we walked to the pier and harbour and I took a photo. I had a look round the British Home Stores. Quite a few stops seem to stay open on Sunday here.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea, we again walked down to the beach and then at about 8.45pm we walked round Dreamland. I took a photograph of the lights. We can see the Helter Skelter and Wheel from our bedroom window and also the railway.</P>

<h3>MONDAY 30th JULY
</h3>
<table width="750" border=0><tr valign="top">
   <td width=550 valign="top">

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went for a walk down to the beach early this morning before breakfast. Grandad was already down on the sea-front to get a cup of tea.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The weather seemed to be quite a bit warmer and after sitting on the beach for a bit and going to the station for a luggage form, Dad and I bathed in the sea. We changed in the Sun Deck Bathing Pavilion. There is a large bathing pool here too. I practised the breast stroke. I really intend to swim this year.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner, we walked past the Harbour to Cliftonville where I played on the beach with Dad.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight we sat on the beach and then went to Dreamland. Clarice &amp; Julia and Dad &amp; Grandad went on the Scenic Railway.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We are staying on at the &ldquo;Moranna&rdquo; until Monday so we shall have a little extra time.</P>

<h3>TUESDAY 31st JULY
</h3>
<table width="750" border=0><tr valign="top">
   <td width=550 valign="top">

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I woke up in the early hours of the morning. [It is my 16th birthday. The card illustrated is from Clarice.] There was quite a storm with thunder and lightning and heavy rain. It didn&rsquo;t keep me awake for more than a few minutes and when I awoke the sun was shining. I was out before breakfast again.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the morning, Dad and I bathed in the pool with Clarice &amp; Julia too.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the afternoon we went shopping and then sat on the beach and ate ice-cream.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I thought it would be a good idea to try to photograph some of the gulls. I walked along across the hundreds of little rock pools which make up the breakwater down to the water&rsquo;s edge. I didn&rsquo;t get a photo but I did see several Little Terns diving vertically for tiny fishes. They had noticeably smaller tail streamers.</P>

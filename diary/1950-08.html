<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I fetched my <I>B.O.P.</I> and <I>Meccano Magazine</I> and bought an &ldquo;Ilford Selochrome&rdquo; film to take on holiday with me.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent all the afternoon playing cricket with the boys in the street.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I went to Cubs. Actually only seven cubs came as the remainder were on their holidays. Afterwards I went to Scouts. Fourteen Scouts are camping at Shirley next Saturday for three nights. It will be the troop&rsquo;s first camp for many years. Were it not for the expense and the fact that we are going to the Hopkins&rsquo; for tea next Monday, I would very much like to go.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After going shopping this morning Dad and I made some cement &amp; proceeded to cement the crazy-paving at the bottom of the garden. It took us all afternoon to finish the job.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Mam &amp; Dad went to the cinema. At 9.15 I listened to the second of a series of eight very interesting talks, &ldquo;The Nature of the Universe&rdquo; by Fred Hoyle. For the first time I learned that the sun is getting hotter by the continual conversion of Hydrogen into Helium.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up at about ten o&rsquo;clock today. I washed up after breakfast &amp; then I cut part of the lawn. I also read today&rsquo;s <I>Rover</I> [No. 1310, price 2d. The front cover is devoted to &ldquo;Customs that occur every year in Britain&rdquo;, such as weighing in the new mayor of High Wycombe, the giant football match at Alnwick, and rolling the cheeses at Witcomb. The stories I am following are &ldquo;The Tough of the Track&rdquo; (Alf Tupper), &ldquo;The Nameless One&rdquo; (Len Hamlet), and &ldquo;The Menace in Pit 19&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t usually read &ldquo;Pony Express&rdquo;].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I cycled to Elmdon Airport &amp; watched the aeroplanes landing &amp; taking off. Before I left I saw the Air-Link from France arrive.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I spent doing Chemistry revision for a couple of hours as well as listening to a &ldquo;P.C.49&rdquo; adventure.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been very warm again today.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was again late when I got up this morning. I spent part of the morning shopping in the village with Mam.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I took Clarice and Julia to Elmdon Airport and we went into the Public Enclosure. There was considerably more activity than yesterday in the afternoon, and we saw two B.E.A. Dakotas arrive, one from Belfast and the other from Jersey. It was quite thrilling to see the plane in the distance, then watch it approach &amp; lightly touch down on the runway &amp; finally come to rest. It was an enjoyable afternoon especially as it was so warm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Mam &amp; Dad went to the cinema. I read a book.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was precisely a quarter to eleven when I aroused myself to reality (woke up) this morning. As breakfast was just a little later than usual (!) we made it do as dinner as well.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning, or should I say, afternoon, I cycled with Dad on to the Stratford Road. Then I cycled to Shirley to see what the Scouts were doing at camp. I stayed for the rest of the afternoon &amp; played football for over half an hour. There are six tents including a Marquee &amp; the camp is on Jack Mould&rsquo;s Sports Ground. The camp is in the nature of an experiment really but the experience should be useful for future camps.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I cycled to Camp &amp; after tea I played outside &amp; took Ginger for her evening walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon we had been invited to tea by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Hopkins [at 143 Queens Road, Yardley, so we went on the Outer Circle No 11 &rsquo;bus from Acocks Green village to the Yew Tree, and there caught the 15 &rsquo;bus to Queens Road]. We had a very nice tea outside &amp; afterwards we played deck tennis &amp; golf. Trevor &amp; I also played over in the park opposite &amp; Dad &amp; Mr. Hopkins joined us after a while.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went down the village and later went to the park to get some aquarium insects. The Water Scorpion annihilated three [pond-]skaters &amp; one beetle so I put him back in the stream. We got ten new Pond-Skaters and five Water Beetles. I hope to be able to fix a siphon to the aquarium soon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon Mam took us to Elmdon Airport &amp; while there I saw one of B.C.T.&rsquo;s 35 new Leyland Olympic Single-Deck buses (No. 2261). The &ldquo;Olympics&rdquo; are chassisless &amp; have underfloor engines. Their seating capacity is 40 but B.C.T.&rsquo;s seat 36 to provide greater comfort.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Focus on cricket! Today Warwickshire started their match v West Indies. I arrived at 9.15 &amp; did not get in until 11.15, a few minutes after the boys&rsquo; entrance was opened. Dr. Harold Thwaite unveiled a new scoreboard to the memory of his late wife before play began at 11.30. West Indies won the toss &amp; chose to bat. Grove soon had Rae bowled with his second ball &amp; at lunch had taken the wickets of Stallmeyer &amp; Worrell as well for 19 runs. Indies were all out for 156 &amp; Grove took 8 for 38 (Marshall 33, Worrell 29, Williams 21). It was the season&rsquo;s best bowling v the tourists. At the close of play Warwick were 87 for 5, (J.R. Thompson 26, Don Taylor 24).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Hopkins called for me at 5.45 this morning. We travelled to Bude via Bromsgrove &amp; Worcester, Tewkesbury, Gloucester and Clifton where we saw the Suspension Bridge. From there we took the route travelling through Bridgwater &amp; then on to Bideford.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There was some very fine scenery throughout Devon as we sped to the South Western [peninsula]. We ran into rain patches now &amp; again but on the road from Bideford to Bude in North Cornwall there was a very thick mist which slowed us down a little. We arrived however, safely enough, at 24 Victoria Road at 3.45 &mdash; earlier than we expected. It was pouring with rain.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After going for a walk we played card games.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast today we went for a walk before going to the Central Methodist Church at 11.0am.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Bude is a town of about 5, 000 in population. It is a somewhat straggly place, bounded by cliffs &amp; typical of the Cornish coast. There are some fine sands however. One of the many attractions is the bathing pool which is washed by the sea every high tide &amp; this is where we headed. I paddled in the sea &amp; hunted in the many rock pools. The weather was very fine &amp; warm. There are hundreds of gulls here.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea we went to the Flexbury Park Methodist Church &amp; had a very interesting service. At 8.0pm we all went down the Strand to meet Trevor&rsquo;s cousin Barbara.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner, Mr. H., Trev &amp; I played beach hockey with the Children&rsquo;s Special Service Mission. The C.S.S.M. is a world-wide organisation &amp; one of its chief activities is the organising of beach services &amp; games for those on holiday.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had our tea in the beach hut we have hired for then fortnight. After tea we walked North over the Cliffs &amp; came back across country. There were lots of people surfing when we got back to the beach.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;High tea came at 7.10. It was cold &amp; windy at this time.</P>

<P>Dear Mam and Dad,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am having quite an enjoyable time here. The food is good and the bed I share with Trevor is comfortable enough.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Sunday&rsquo;s weather was very fine &amp; warm. After breakfast the four of us went for a walk over the cliffs and then we went to the Central Methodist Church. After dinner I paddled in the sea &amp; explored some of the rock pools here. After tea we went to the Flexbury Park Methodist Church. There was a very interesting sermon preached by a visiting preacher.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After church, we went &ldquo;down the Strand&rdquo; to meet Trevor&rsquo;s cousin Barbara from Coventry. After supper we walked along the cliffs.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday (Monday) the weather was fine during the morning &amp; Mr. H., Trevor &amp; I bathed in the Bathing Pool. The pool is washed by the sea every high tide. Mr. H., &amp; Trevor would insist in [<I>sic</I>] tipping me out of the rubber dinghy. By all accounts I am now considerably cleaner although I washed my face the day before yesterday.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday afternoon was cooler &amp; cloudy but I played beach hockey with the Children&rsquo;s Special Service Mission &amp; Scripture Union. We had tea in our Beach Hut &amp; then went for a walk over the cliffs the other way &amp; back across country.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning we went round the shops &amp; then had coffee &amp; ices in a caf&eacute;. Later we all went down to the beach.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I will write again before the end of the week.</P>

<P>My dear Son,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Received your letter this morning first post. Needless to say we all have missed you very much, including Ginger Brownhound. I hope the weather has improved over there. Sunday and today has been quite decent. I took Clarice, Julia and Ginger to Cannon Hill Park today (Monday). This morning the very first thing I thought of was your white knicks. I remembered I had taken out the elastic intending to put you some new in, however I forgot (nothing unusual).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Well Brian, do you like the place? and are you contented? I hope you are, and I do hope you will come back looking and feeling very fit. Be very careful, won&rsquo;t you? as regards the cliffs. If there is anything you need, don&rsquo;t hesitate to let me know, will you?</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember me to Mr &amp; Mrs Hopkins. I shall be writing them later. I will send you the elastic for the knicks on Tuesday or Wednesday. I probably shall include it in Mr &amp; Mrs Hopkins letter. Would you care to send Dr Dawes a p.c. I think he would appreciate it, Brian, however please yourself, but if you do his address is 205 High St, Smethwick.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Well my Son this is about all for now so I will say Good Night God Bless you, look after yourself. Clarice, Julia, Dad and myself send all our Love.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you very much for your letter card. I was very pleased to know you are enjoying yourself. Make the best of every minute my pet. I know it seems selfish but I shall be glad when your holiday&rsquo;s over, and once more you are back again. You will understand I know when I say it&rsquo;s not because we&rsquo;re worried about you because we know you are in exceptionally good hands, couldn&rsquo;t be better, but it&rsquo;s because we love and miss you so. I wonder if you have missed us.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The weather has been dreadful today. It&rsquo;s poured heaven&rsquo;s hard, did not clear up till about 6.30 then there was a beautiful rainbow. I am looking after your bowl of mystery. I must confess I had to have the skaters out, and the water beetles, you see I didn&rsquo;t know what to get for dinner, so I killed the beetles and stuffed them with the skaters, then I rolled them in flour, put salt and pepper on them, and fried them with the snail juice. They were very tasty indeed. We are waiting for you to come home so that you can get some more beetles and skaters, also snails.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;How is Trevor getting on? I expect like yourself, he&rsquo;s having the time of his life. Give my kind regards to him, also his Mam and Dad. Did you send Dr Dawes a p.c.? We shall in all probability have a surprise awaiting your return. Clarice and Julia said it seems such a long time since you went away. I am to inform you not to bring them back a bracelet owing to the fact they already have one. Have you bought yourself any sweets?</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Well Brian time is getting on, it&rsquo;s 10.10pm so I shall have to bring this letter to a close but I will write to you again (God Be Willing) before your return. Until then look after yourself, enjoy yourself, I won&rsquo;t say behave yourself because I know you will do so.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Good Night and God Bless you all</P>

<P>Dear Brian,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope you are having a nice time. The weather here is not very good. It has been raining nearly all the time. The pond-skaters are all dead. The big snails have been eating them. I saw one go after the pond skater. It rolled its eyes and stuck out its horns, it did look perculear. Tell Mrs Hopkins thank you very much for the card. Hurry up and come back. We all miss you very much.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I had separate letters from Dad and Mam this morning:&mdash;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;153 Circular Rd,
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Acocks Green</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20/8/50</P>

<P>Dear Brian,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;You will be surprised to hear from your old pop but here goes. In the first place, give my kindest regards to Mr &amp; Mrs Hopkins, and Trevor. Tell them I expect to owe them something when you get back, you know, eating up all the food. Well you should look much better for it, and when school days start again your Mother and I want you to go from last to first, and I don&rsquo;t mean may-be. The letter we received from Mr Hopkins tells us that the weather is very mixed, but I hope it is a better mixture than we are having, for in the garden the grass is too wet to cut at all.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Last Saturday all our family went to the B.S.A. flower show. It just managed to keep fine. Ginger took a First Prize, and paid for our afternoon out. Clarice won two races, and I took a prize or two for flowers. We arrived home round 8.30pm. Today Sunday it has rained on and off all day, with no sun in between.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Have made up my mind to post this letter tonight instead of waiting for tomorrow Monday. I was going to include a postal order for you, but tell me on the next card, if you can cash it without much trouble, and I will send it by return of post. With the weather you are having I don&rsquo;t suppose you have learned to swim yet but never mind, you will some-time in the future. Now Brian, hold your chest up, and take some of the deepest breaths you have taken, for they will have to last you until next year.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ask Mr &amp; Mrs Hopkins if there is anything here they would like me to do for them, if so, let me know.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your mother, Clarice and Julie wish to be remembered to you all, with your mother saying the time seems to be dragging, but I hope it is not going too quick for you. Well I think I have told you all for now, so will close, with lots of good wishes for you all.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From all at 153.</P>

<P>P.S. We received your <I>Listener</I>s, only two copies, one was out of print, and I got one from Dorlings.]</P>

<P>As I have never been away from home before, this is the first time I have had a letter from Dad. It is written in blue ink with his Conway Stewart pen, and the envelope is postmarked &ldquo;Acocks Green, Birmingham 27, 9.30 am 21 Aug 1950&rdquo;. It must have been raining still when Dad posted it as the ink is smudged. Dad is not one to talk about himself and is very reticent about his accomplishments. The &ldquo;prize or two&rdquo; for his flowers probably includes several Firsts, Seconds or Thirds, or Highly Commended.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam&rsquo;s letter is postmarked &ldquo;Birmingham 7.30pm 20 Aug 1950&rdquo; so she probably posted it in town:&mdash;<BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;21/8/50</P>

<P>My Dear Son,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Received your letter this morning, for which I thank you. I am so pleased to know you are enjoying yourself and feeling the benefit by gaining in weight. I do so hope you will be able to keep it up even when you return home, although I very much doubt it because, naturally it&rsquo;s the change of air which gives one an appetite, also the change.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Well Brian I am taking Clarice and Julia to Kidderminster on Thursday (God Be Willing), probably you would like to go with Trevor for a day when you return, however that can be planned later. Ginger caught a huge rat on Sunday night in Wetherby Road round about 10.20. She would not drop it and carried it all the time, hoping your Dad would let her bring it in the shed. No amount of scolding made any difference, but after a time she put it down, she had killed it of course.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The weather here has been very bad except Saturday, that just managed to keep fine. No doubt your Dad told you about Saturday. Yesterday (Sunday) it poured heavens hard all day. Today (Monday) it&rsquo;s every appearance of keeping fine, the sun is shining.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am glad you sent a p.c. to Dr Dawes, it&rsquo;s very kind of you, and I know he will appreciate it. He probably is on holiday but he will get it when he returns. Tell, Mr &amp; Mrs Hopkins I will have a pot of tea awaiting them, tell them I shall expect them to have a cup of tea after their long journey, even if they don&rsquo;t have anything else.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;A week today Monday morning I am having a decorator it, he will start on the living room first, and the lounge next, probably my bedroom after. Your Dad will of course have it furnished (God be Willing). I am thinking of having the kitchen improved, new lino and a cabinet? I hope so anyway, so you see, my pet, I shall be pretty busy within the next few days. I am now about to start on the lounge clearing out the rubbish. I shall not write again of course so I will close by saying enjoy yourself to the best of your ability, make the very most of your holiday that&rsquo;s left to you. Give my kind regards to Mr &amp; Mrs H. also Trevor and the other young person staying with you.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Cheerio, all our Love from your Loving Mam, Dad, Clarice &amp; Julia, and also Ginger Brownhound.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning after having a pot of tea in the beach hut as usual, we played cricket and then bathed in the sea as the tide was coming in. (Bathing at low tide is dangerous). Mr. Hopkins and Trevor hired a surf board.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner Trevor &amp; I went canoeing on the canal for a couple of hours. The canal is an interesting stretch of water &mdash; there are many wild duck as well as moorhens and coots.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;So far at Bude I have seen four species of gulls and a pair of ravens, not to mention pied wagtails in abundance.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight we went to the &ldquo;Picture House&rdquo; &amp; saw <I>Prelude to Fame</I> (U), and an amusing supporting film. [The film, based on an Aldous Huxley story, was about a child musical prodigy, played by Jeremy Spenser, whose health is put at risk by a scheming woman.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast today Trevor and I fetched the newspapers from town, and then it rained until eleven when we had coffee etc., in a caf&eacute;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner Mrs. Hopkins &amp; Barbara went to Holsworthy market. Trevor &amp; I played cricket on the beach &amp; then bathed in the sea with Mr. Hopkins.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The weather cleared considerably during the afternoon &amp; we also played golf together.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the evening I went for a walk along the canal. The Bude &amp; Holsworthy Canal, built in 1819&ndash;26 extended 30 miles, but is now navigable for only 1&frac12; miles. The rest of the canal is overgrown.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We decided today to go to Tintagel some 17 miles away. [Before leaving I sent my parents a Frith&rsquo;s sepia postcard called &ldquo;Rough Sea at Bude&rdquo;. It bears a KGVI 2p orange stamp and reads:&mdash;</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your letters &amp; also thank Bob for his letter. Monday&rsquo;s weather was fine &amp; we all went to Plymouth for the day. Trev &amp; I went round the docks in a mo-boat &amp; saw the &ldquo;Amethyst&rdquo;. On Tuesday, bathed in the sea &amp; went canoeing on canal. On Wednesday bathed again. Today we are off to Tintagel. Home Saturday! Will probably arrive between 7 and 8.0pm. I can&rsquo;t say for sure.<BR>

<P>We started off at about 11.30am and we went through Boscastle; on arrival at Tintagel we had dinner in the car.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner we went to King Arthur&rsquo;s Hall &mdash; a visit which proved to be very interesting. We then walked through Tintagel towards the sea where the remains of King Arthur&rsquo;s Castle stand upon a headland. We explored the castle.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;From the headland one can see the coastline north from Bude to Hartland Point &amp; Lundy Island is also visible.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We got back to Bude for tea &amp; afterwards I listened to the radio while the others played a hilarious game of cards with Miss Chamberlain.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went for a short walk before having breakfast this morning. Last day of our holidays! We spent most of the morning playing Deck Tennis on the Beach.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I took a photograph &amp; then went into town. We bathed in the sea again this afternoon. It was rough as usual. A beach patrol keeps watch continually on the bathers. After our dip I played on the beach.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea we went for a short walk &amp; then Miss Chamberlain came in to play cards with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Hopkins, Barbara &amp; Trevor.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;And so ends our holidays [<I>sic</I>]. They have been most enjoyable: the weather hasn&rsquo;t been too fine but it certainly hasn&rsquo;t been any better elsewhere.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Once more I am writing my Diary at home. We said Goodbye to Miss Chamberlain &amp; Barbara, who is staying until tomorrow, then left Bude just before 9.0am. We took practically the same route as a fortnight ago:&mdash; Bideford, Barnstaple, Bridgwater, Bristol, Gloucester, Tewkesbury, and then Evesham, Alcester &amp; finally at 7.35 Acocks Green.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s good to be back again. Ginger Brownhound seemed especially pleased. Last Sunday evening she caught a rat in Wetherby Road &amp; a cat yesterday.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On Monday we are having a Decorator in to do one or two of the rooms which want doing badly.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast today I went to Dorlings to get my <I>Listener</I> and <I>B.O.P.</I> Later I took down the weather readings for the past week or two.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner we transferred the furniture from the Dining Room into the Lounge.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I read <I>The Mountain of Adventure</I> by Enid Blyton. I seem to read quite a variety of literature &mdash; Ornithology, Astronomy, Chemistry, Railway literature, Sports, a Comic or two, at least a couple of good boys&rsquo; magazines [<I>Boy&rsquo;s Own Paper</I> and <I>Meccano Magazine</I>], story books and <I>Personal Evangelism</I> by J.W.R. Stott, M.A., a little booklet I brought home from Bude.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today the decorator came &amp; started work on the Dining Room. Mam and I spent over an hour choosing wall paper for the other rooms. We got the paper from a shop on the Stratford Road.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent the afternoon indoors helping the decorator and I think I know considerably more about paper-hanging now than I did before. Mr. Elwell finished the room by 6.30 &amp; after tea we set to work in transporting everything back in again. The room looks fine &amp; very much lighter. The paper is cream with a wheat-ear pattern. The green distemper was really terribly drab and depressing.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I have spent an hour in doing homework.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I stayed in &amp; listened to &ldquo;P.C.49&rdquo;. Then I had a bath before going to bed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday there was heavy rain in Cornwall &amp; Bude was flooded, the roads being under 5ft of water. The canal broke its banks. People were swimming in the streets checking up on stranded families, while at high tide a heavy sea poured into the River Strat.</P>

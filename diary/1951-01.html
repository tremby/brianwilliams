<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am writing my diary in paragraphs this year but I am having a smaller margin. [I had this <I>Datada Diary</I> for Christmas. It is No. C181 &frac14; Bound Cloth. As usual I have written my full name on the fly-leaf and stuck my photograph underneath, cut out of the <I>Birmingham Mail</I>. The Diary is published by T.J. &amp; J.Smith Ltd., (Established 1839), Lombard Road, London, S.W.19.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I woke up at 9.15am and after breakfast put up three new calendars. We went up town at about midday as Mam wanted to go to the January sales and I wanted to obtain some weather readings from the <I>Mail</I> offices.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I bought a copy of the <I>BBC Year Book 1949</I> which had been reduced [from 3/6d] to 1/-d. It was in almost perfect condition except for its torn jacket. [It is extremely interesting, with numerous articles including &ldquo;Adventures in Sound Recording&rdquo; by Ludwig Koch, &ldquo;Town Forum&rdquo; by Denis Morris, and &ldquo;Radio Personalities of 1948&rdquo;. Among the many photographs is one of Anthea Askey who was Violet Elizabeth in Richmal Crompton&rsquo;s <I>Just William</I>&mdash;which we used to love listening to.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We got home for 5.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I have listened to a programme entitled <I>Memories of Itma</I> for forty-five minutes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I woke up this morning to find everywhere in the grip of snow &mdash; a foot deep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam put out a lot of fat and scraps and during the morning we had many Starlings, a pair of Blackbirds, a Robin, Blue Tits and for the first time this winter the Greenfinch to visit us.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had a letter from Bob [Vitoria] by first post this morning, and yesterday I heard from Donald Tipper.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went out to clear the snow away during the morning and I took Ginger out as well. She revelled in the snow.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;For the remainder of the morning I watched the Starlings fighting, completely read a book this afternoon and took Ginger for her walk this evening.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went to the Olton Cinema to see Leo Genn, Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson in <I>The Wooden Horse</I> at the Olton. It was a superb film in every way and was adopted [sic] from Eric Williams&rsquo; book of the same title. The filming was done in Germany and Sweden.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There were three supporting films &ldquo;The Fair Country of Ayr&rdquo;, &ldquo;Johann Strauss Polkas&rdquo; a musical film featuring the Vienna Orchestra and containing some fine ballet and a short Donald Duck film.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I wrote another chapter [of <I>Smugglers&rsquo; Bay</I>] and listened to a play.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went down the village, taking Hound with me. Mam went to town. I put some water into the aquarium but it leaked very slightly as the putty was still wet. So I cannot put the Goldfish into it yet.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner Clarice, Julia and I went out into the street. Half of the snow had disappeared and the rest was melting quickly (the temperature was in the forties). We unblocked a couple of drains so that much of the water in the gutters soon disappeared. Mam got back at 3.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I stayed in for most of the morning as it was raining. Very little snow was left by this morning.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did however, go down the village twice today with Ginger to do some shopping.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;For most of the afternoon I wrote some more of my book and I continued this tonight. Mam and Dad have gone to see <I>The Wooden Horse</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went to see B&rsquo;ham City play Manchester City in the 3rd Round of the FA Cup. Unfortunately the pitch was not in a very good state owing to snow earlier in the week and rain for the past two days.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The teams were as follows: B&rsquo;ham: Merrick; Green, Martin; Boyd, Atkins, Ferris; Stewart, Dorman, Trigg, Higgins, Berry. Man City: Trautman, Branagan, Phillips; Paul, Fagan, Spurdle; Gunning, Haddington, Westcott, Smith, Westwood.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Blues assumed complete mastery from the start and played superlatively, winning 2&ndash;0. Stewart and Higgins scored.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;If Blues are drawn at home next round and play as well as they did today then they might well go far in this year&rsquo;s competition.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It rained steadily nearly all of this morning so I stayed in for most of the morning.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;However, after dinner Mam decided to take us to the cinema. We went down to the Olton first of all but there was a big queue to see <I>Rogues of Sherwood Forest</I> so we walked to the Warwick where we got in easily enough.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a good programme. The two films were <I>Johnny Holiday</I> with William Bendix, Dick Powell and Allan Martin, and <I>Mrs. Mike</I> with Evelyn Keyes. Both were &ldquo;A&rdquo; films.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I liked the first especially and the second film was fair.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I felt tired, more so than usual, and went to bed at nine o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I cycled round to John Winrow&rsquo;s [16 Bourne Close, Kings Heath] where I stayed for an hour.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I went to Cubs as usual. We were to have held our party tonight but it has been put forward to next week as no one turned up last Tuesday &amp; no arrangements were made.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got home at 8.30pm just in time to hear a recording of the 300th edition of ITMA. This was first broadcast on October 28th 1948 and today&rsquo;s recording was to mark the second anniversary of Tommy Handley&rsquo;s death.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I woke up this morning to find it raining hard. This meant that I was unable to go for a walk with Ginger as I thought I might do earlier.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went to Stephen Chadwin&rsquo;s [1480 Pershore Road, Stirchley] where I had been invited to tea. Stephen met me half way from the &rsquo;bus stop and told me that he suspected there was a Gadwall in Cannon Hill Park. We went to the park and found the duck feeding with the Mallard. It was brown, slightly smaller than a Mallard, had a white bar on the wing, grey pencilled markings on the flank and a chestnut breast. All these markings comply with those of the Drake Gadwall &mdash; a rare visitor.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Later at 5.0pm we watched the Children&rsquo;s Hour T.V. programme.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After Prayers we went to form rooms [Upper V.C.&lsquo;s is room 19] to be issued with stationery and to buy dinner tickets. The Fixture Cards are still at the Printers&rsquo; and I don&rsquo;t suppose we shall receive them for a fortnight. We haven&rsquo;t had the School Chronicle yet, either.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. [Junior Training Corps] we did some mutual drill and then went into the Armoury to do some L.M.G. [Light Machine Gun] revision.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town. I got some ink-eradicator with which I erased one or two mistakes in my diaries.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was unable to get a game of football during the dinner hour.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;During first period in the afternoon &mdash; English [with Mr. L.K.J. Cooke] &mdash; we read Wordsworth&rsquo;s <I>Westminster Bridge</I> sonnet. This is one of my favourite poems and another is Wordsworth&rsquo;s <I>Daffodils</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town and called in at Bob&rsquo;s office [at Kodak] in Charlotte Street. Bob has got a new bird book for me, <I>Making Friends with Birds</I>, which he is going to give me tomorrow.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town and collected the Book from Bob. [<I>Making Friends with Birds</I> is by Arthur F. Park, F.R.P.S., and was published in 1948 by Chatto and Windus. It cost 21/- new, but Bob told me he had not paid that much for it. It has 216 pages full of wonderful photographs, together with photographic data.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went to Stephen&rsquo;s for tea and to watch the T.V. We saw the 1st Round FA Amateur Cup match between Hendon &amp; Smethwick Highfield. Hendon won 2&ndash;nil. Then there was &ldquo;For the Children&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Telescope&rdquo; &mdash; a fortnightly magazine and at eight o&rsquo;clock for forty-five minutes, &ldquo;Picture Page&rdquo;.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happened at school today. During the afternoon I wrote some notes in my Natural History note-book.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I went to the Warwick cinema in order to see <I>The Blue Lamp</I>. This film was given a very good write-up by all the film critics in the newspapers and must have been one of 1950&rsquo;s three best films.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Jack Warner played the part of the P.C. with Jimmy Hanley, Dirk Bogarde, Meredith Edwards, Robert Flemyng, Bernard Lee, Patric Doonan, Peggy Evans, Gladys Henson and Dora Bryan]. I thought it a superb film all round. [<I><I>Dixon of Dock Green</I></I>, based on the Jack Warner character, will run for 20 years on TV.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went round to the newsagent&rsquo;s and then I went for a walk with Ginger to the Park. It was fairly warm out and, in fact, has been for over a fortnight. The last occasion on which we had frost was on the 3rd.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner, Mam and I went to the Mission where Mr. C.H. Watts was the Speaker.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing else happened all day.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We postponed a debate to be held in English this morning as the Sixth and Upper Fifths had to assemble in Big School at 12.15pm to hear a talk on Colonial Service. This was given by Mr. Humphrey, an Old Edwardian who was at school from 1919 to 1924.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town and bought a copy of <I>Lord Edgware Dies</I> by Agatha Christie. During the afternoon I did some homework and read a few chapters of the book.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to Cubs at 6.30pm. The week before the Party the attendance was twenty one out of twenty five. Today, a week after the Party, nine turned up.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual the day has passed uneventfully enough. In Biology we are still studying soil and bacteria.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I played football during the lunch-hour. We had a test during the Double Maths period this afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the Special Bus. During the evening I did homework and also finished reading my new book. I thought it a very well-written book indeed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We received our Fixture Cards this morning on leaving Big School.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In French we are reading Guy de Maupassant&rsquo;s <I>Les Prisonniers</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. we had a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s mutual drill and then we went into the adjacent field to do some revision of firing orders and section leading.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon the first round ties of the Knock-Out Cup Competition were played. We were drawn against Williams&rsquo;. As usual was picked to lead the 2nd XV forwards. We had only eleven men. This was largely instrumental to our 38&ndash;6 defeat. The 1st XV lost 37&ndash;3 with thirteen men.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time I played football but otherwise nothing happened.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual I came home on the Special Bus. While Mam and Dad were at the cinema tonight, I did homework from seven until nearly ten o&rsquo;clock. I also heard &ldquo;Any Questions?&rdquo; at 8.0pm, a special Australia Day variety show at 9.0 and the second part of &ldquo;Miss Dangerfield and the Irresistible Nightingale&rdquo; a comedy thriller at 9.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We received the <I>Chronicle</I> after prayers this morning but there is nothing else to record. [The <I>King Edward&rsquo;s School Chronicle</I> is published in January and July.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At Derby this afternoon, in front of a record crowd of 38,384 spectators at the Baseball Ground, Blues defeated Derby County by three goals to one (Smith, Stewart, Trigg; Lee) and so have reached the 5th Round of the FA Cup. By all accounts it was quite a deserved win too.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At Molineux Wolves beat Villa 3&ndash;1.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to the Olton to see <I>Seven Days to Noon</I>, a very good film. It is about a scientist who threatens to blow up London with a new bomb of which he is the inventor unless the Government promises to withhold these bombs from warfare. The other film was <I><I>Sierra Sue</I></I> with Gene Autry &amp; his horse Champion.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was top in Geography this morning with fourteen out of twenty marks. I also got 100% for Maths and one of the highest marks for French.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Fred Oxley took Choir Practice again. Dr. Willis Grant has been absent for ten days now.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Cotter took both Gym classes this afternoon. We had five minutes of netball. I scored the only goal.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I just caught the Special Bus home. I spent all the evening doing homework until ten o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been foggy for most of the day though it is also freezing at the moment.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning we debated the motion &ldquo;This House believes that Parity of Esteem is a desirable object in present day education&rdquo;. The opposition failed to put any proper argument against the proposition. In fact, apart from arguing that equal education was undesirable, which was not anything to do with the question, I am now a member of the Communist Party. Other &ldquo;red-herrings&rdquo; were labourers (farm and other species), cooking, trades in general, wheelbarrows and dustmen. It was a most unconvincing performance by the opposition. When put to the vote, the result was a draw 3&ndash;3 with one abstention.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much else happened but I went to Cubs tonight.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I received a letter from Cecil Madden, Head of Children&rsquo;s Television programmes. He has promised to keep me in mind for a Television audition.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Geography we have studied the Physiography of The Scottish Highlands, the Southern Uplands and the Central Valley. We are now studying the Lake District.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing else happened all day. After school I went to an Alto practice which had to be cancelled owing to an examination which was taking place.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the evening I did some prep and pressed my uniform. I went to bed just after ten o&rsquo;clock.</P>

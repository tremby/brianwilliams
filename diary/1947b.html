<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today I went to see Birmingham City play Fulham at St. Andrews. Blues won 2&ndash;1. There were 4 changes from the team printed in the programme.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Birmingham City:&mdash; Merrick; Jennings <I>(not Trigg)</I>, Hughes; Harris, Duckhouse, Mitchell; Goodwin <I>(not Mulraney)</I>, McIntosh <I>(not Dougall)</I>, Hall <I>(not Massart)</I>, Bodle, Edwards. Hall (on his first appearance) and Goodwin scored their first goals for Blues. About 30,000 were there.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Scorers for Blues this season (excluding today):&mdash; Trigg 19, Mulraney 10, Bodle 9, Dougall 6, Edwards 6, Jones 5, Mitchell 3 (penalties), Duckhouse 2, Harris 1, McIntosh 1, Dorman 1, Dearson 1. Cyril Trigg is brilliant, but would get a lot more goals if he could always play centre forward instead of right back. Dave Massart has scored 16 and Wilson Jones 13 for the Reserves.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Double Summer Time began today. The clocks have gone forward another hour, so we are now two hours ahead of the sun, and it will still be light at 9 o&rsquo;clock. From 24th February 1940 we never went back to the proper time &mdash; we were on British Summer Time all through the War until 7th October 1945, with Double Summer Time in operation in 1941 (4th May to 10th August), 1942 (5th April to 9th August), 1943 (4th April to 15th August), 1944 (2nd April to 17th September) and 1945 (2nd April to 15th July). This was to help the farmers.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The practice of putting the clocks forward an hour started in the Great War (21st May 1916) and has continued ever since. Last year we had British Summer Time from 14th April to 6th October but there was no Double Summer Time. I see from this Diary that the sun rises this Friday at 5.0 and sets at 7.0, but that is obviously Greenwich Mean Time.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp;My dear John,
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am writing to you to find out whether you could come for a little excursion on Tuesday next. I thought it would be a good time for us at Yarningale on the afternoon. It&rsquo;s lovely out there just now. We walk about thirteen miles from Hatton Station. You will quite likely be able to add some wild flowers to your collection. We can have a fine time on the common and we can go a different way home along the Grand Union Canal where we can do a spot of fishing. So don&rsquo;t delay in letting me know. The train fare [from Acocks Green and South Yardley] is 1s 4d return. By the way bring some sandwiches etc., and we&rsquo;ll stay for tea.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I will close now as I want to send this by the next post. So Au Revoir.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yours sincerely,</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Brian.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As one of my favourite hobbies is train-spotting I have chosen Railways as the subject for my latest essay:&mdash;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;About one hundred years ago, there were no railways at all. Since 1835 railways have grown considerably, Several companies started their own railways. Colliery and coal-mine railways were started. In the early 1900s there were about 250 different railways. So it was decided in 1923 to join them into four big companies, i.e. the GWR, LMS, LNER, SR.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then there was the building of the railways. Viaducts and banks had to be made. In many cases a tunnel was needed to go through a hill or high land. Then, when the railways were going well, the adopting of the narrow gauge took place. Wood was needed for sleepers. Also iron for rails, though for a time they too were of wood.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The railway&rsquo;s uses were for passengers as well as goods and minerals. When railways began, many people would not trust them. In those days (a century ago) there were trucks with a few seats in for third class coaches. Second class ones were a little better, while the first class coaches which could have been the best were right behind the engine, so that there were clouds of smoke round you.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;And now with our extensive railways which have grown from the Stockton &amp; Darlington Company, we intend even greater things for the future, &mdash; perhaps atomic power will be used or jet-propulsion. We cannot answer that question yet so we must wait till the time comes.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Howe has used his red pen to underline &ldquo;you&rdquo; at the end of the third paragraph, and written &ldquo;I was not there&rdquo;. But he has given me 9/10. And I am still using prepositions to start paragraphs with.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Morris asked me what I wanted to be etc. [and I told him, a doctor, which is what Mam always tells everyone I am going to be], and I had to read from a book containing rather a lot of French, but I think I read it intelligently.</P>

When we got changed I was the only boy wearing a full-length costume and I was very embarrassed because it is orange and black and everybody laughed. We were divided into two groups and those who can swim went to the deep end. The rest of us were standing about and Mr. Titt said the boy with the red costume was to walk down the steps and into the water, making swimming movements with my arms, with everybody following me.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have written a short story in my English exercise book today, and included the date as I remembered that it is two years since the War ended.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Although it is peace-time now, everything is still rationed &mdash; bread (4&frac14;d a loaf), milk, butter, margarine (which Mam buys as it is cheaper), cheese, cooking fat, bacon, eggs, meat, tea, sugar, jam, marmalade, sweets and chocolate. We can get potatoes though (7lb for 4&frac12;d), and packets of dried egg, also tins of sardines or grade 3 salmon if we have enough points. (I have cut the fishes off the labels and stuck them in my scrap book.) There is also tinned fruit, and we always have an apple and an orange for Christmas.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Clothes are in short supply and have a black Utility label inside, and it is also difficult to get furniture. Fortunately, we still have some of the furniture from Belchers Lane, rescued after we were bombed out on 19&ndash;20th November 1940.

He was transferred to Birmingham City in April 1934 and has also played many times for Wales, especially during the War. One of the men I see at the match was telling us how he saw Don Dearson miss a penalty at St. Andrews when he was playing for Wales against England in a Wartime international, about 5 or 6 years ago.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have written an essay to finish my English Exercise Book:&mdash;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp;Birmingham is situated about in the middle of England and also the centre of the &lsquo;Black Country&rsquo;. Birmingham has over one and a quarter million inhabitants for it is the second largest town in the British Isles.
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Birmingham is crowded with shops and people, railways and buses. The streets are filled with shoppers. All is in a great bustle of noise and the buses and trains go continually to and from the city. Great buildings tower up above the ground. Factories are giving off noise and din as machines, materials and other [things] are being made. So many things are happening even now in the great city of Birmingham.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Besides the factories mentioned the city has its gasworks as well, for gas must be supplied for the 1,250,000 people. And then in the town there is the University. And schools are found all over the great area of Birmingham. At parts of the city, though, newspapers are being printed. Libraries are found in the city (in each district almost). Lastly but not at all least B&rsquo;ham has its own grand Cathedral and churches for those who wish to go to such places on Sundays. The whole of B&rsquo;ham seems to be working.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;But when one gets away into the outer districts he can see quieter districts and even fields occasionally. Here things are different. There is not half as many factories with their big machines. But in the shopping centre of all these villages as they might be called, are, once again, the shops. The grocer, greengrocer, butcher and another great array of shops and people are to be seen.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;But at last the night comes. Shops close. People go back home and the eerie darkness falls. But the street-lamps do their work.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Melville (189 and 104 n.o.) is the first South African ever to score two separate centuries in a Test Match. Compton and Yardley&rsquo;s 5th wicket stand of 237 is the highest for any Test in England. It has been an incredible match.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I made a barometer today. I got the idea when looking through my cigarette cards [actually No. 1 in Wills&rsquo; <I>Household Hints</I>, a set of 50 printed in September 1936]. I got a vinegar bottle and a jam jar, half filled the bottle with water and then poured in some of my red ink to colour it, then I put the jam jar over the bottle and turned them over, letting the water flow into the jar until the level in the neck of the bottle was about an inch above that in the jar. If the water level rises in the neck of the bottle it shows that the atmospheric pressure has increased, meaning fine weather, and if the level goes down, the pressure has decreased, so we shall have rain.</P>

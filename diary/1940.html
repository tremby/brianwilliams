A lone raider was over a Midland village last evening and dropped eight high-explosive and incendiary bombs, all of which fell in a playing field which was deserted at the time. No one was injured. The windows in a few houses were smashed and a fence caught fire. This was quickly extinguished by the local A.F.S. The plane was flying fairly high, but it was possible to distinguish that it was a large bomber. After the bombs had been dropped, the machine made off at a high level.

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>BOMB DIGS HOLE FOR MIDLAND MAN&rsquo;S AIR RAID SHELTER. FELL ON PICKED SPOT.<B></B> Damage in Saturday night&rsquo;s Midlands raid &mdash; the third in five nights &mdash; was very slight, and was confined to dwelling-houses and growing crops. One bomb shattered the windows and damaged the roofs of seven modern semi-detached houses; a number of dwelling-houses were damaged when another bomb fell into a housing estate. Five bombs which fell into a spinney uprooted trees but caused no damage to property. A high-explosive bomb fell into a field of oats, another into a field of turnips, and a screaming bomb, which fell on common land between two public air raid shelters, made a crater ten feet wide and 15 feet deep, but there were no casualties. Another bomb which fell into a roadway in a minor road burst water and gas mains. A motor-cyclist who drove into a bomb crater and was injured was the only casualty. Bombs were dropped early yesterday on a residential district near another Midland town. One unoccupied house was entirely demolished and another partially wrecked, the only two room left being a bedroom occupied by the owner and his wife and the lounge beneath. Most of the bombs fell on soft ground and caused no damage, but one which made a direct hit on a road shattered the windows and brought down tiles from the roof of many houses in the vicinity. There were no personal injuries. One resident stated that a bomb which had made a large crater in his back garden would save a lot of digging in preparation for an air-raid shelter which is to be erected there during the week.

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>EVACUEE SHIP TORPEDOED. BIRMINGHAM CHILDREN AMONG 320 ON BOARD; ALL SAVED. SANG AS THEY TOOK TO LIFEBOATS. Birmingham children were among those aboard a British evacuee ship on its way to Canada, which has been torpedoed in the Atlantic by a U-boat. Not a single child was lost. More than 70 of the children were landed at a Scottish port early yesterday. The vessel was carrying 320 children and other passengers, but there was only one casualty &mdash; the purser of the vessel. The children had been trained by experts in lifeboat drill and to this is attributed the remarkably small casualty list. The children sang &ldquo;Roll out the Barrel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh Johnny Oh&rdquo; as they took to the lifeboats. Many of them were in pyjamas but they were still singing. Most of the children landed clad in little more than pyjamas. Not more than a dozen had stockings. They wore coats of all kinds and blankets. Only the splendid training in boat drill they had received and their coolness in the face of danger can account for their return to safety from an ordeal which lefts its trace on members of the crew. Mr. Geoffrey Shakespeare, Dominions Under-secretary, who welcomed the children, described their return as &ldquo;a miracle.&rdquo; The children had sailed under the supervision of Mr. C. H. Hindley, headmaster of Stoke School, Gosport.</I> (Birmingham Gazette<I>, Monday 2nd September 1940)</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>RAIDERS SCATTER INCENDIARIES. WOMAN PRAYED AS BOMB FELL &mdash; SHE WAS UNHURT. When a special constable forced his way into the ruins of a house hit by an enemy bomb in a South-western coastal town he found an old woman kneeling beside her bed and praying. She was surrounded by broken glass and debris Y but the room was the least damaged in the house. In a bedroom adjoining that in which the praying woman escaped, another old woman was buried by falling rafters, plaster and masonry, and had to be rescued. She escaped with minor injuries and shock. A bedroom above was completely demolished, with the bed hanging into space. The occupants of the house had left on holiday earlier in the day.

Also some business premises were damaged. Thousands of people saw for the first time an enemy plane being attacked by ground defences. Later Spitfires chased the raider, which made off into the clouds. The raider was reported to have machine-gunned part of another town. For a while the raider circled about at a great height. Then gun-fire was heard. The Spitfires swept on to the scene and bursts of machine-gun fire rising above the drone of the machines&rsquo; engines indicated that the fight was on. People ran into the streets, shopkeepers left their counters, and children coming home from school gazed skywards open-mouthed. There were several further bursts of machine-gun fire, and when the raider was put to flight there were cheers from the spectators. High-explosive bombs were dropped and a water main was fractured. Last night&rsquo;s official communiqu&eacute; said: &ldquo;Scattered raids have been attempted in several parts of the country today, most of them in South-east England. In none of these were many bombs dropped, and scarcely any damage or casualties were caused anywhere. Four German bombers have been destroyed during to-day.&rdquo; (<I>Birmingham Gazette</I>, Thursday 14th November 1940) [[]]

Damage to factories in this &ldquo;Birmingham&rdquo; of Germany daily becomes more serious. More and more industries are being transferred to Eastern cities or to occupied Poland. The docks no longer bustle with trade. The burnt-out shells of warehouses, the smashed wharves, tell the tale. Yet all reports agree that the damage is confined to the docks and industrial districts, and that the city itself has been hardly affected. This is a striking tribute to the accuracy of our bombing.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had a terrible Air Raid last night and sheltered under the stairs again. We never go down the dug-out in the garden because it is wet.</P>

<P><table><tr><td width=5% bgcolor="#ff99ff"> &nbsp; </td><td>
This is the 42nd raid on Birmingham. It lasted six hours. 64 Ack-Ack guns around the city fired on the German planes. Bombs fell in the City centre destroying Coates&rsquo;s factory in Essex Street, also in Yardley and Sparkhill.

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp;NIGHT RAIDS. Raiders reported last night over Midlands, London, Wales, N.E. and N.W. England. At Liverpool flares and fire bombs used without success. Fire bombs caused fires in thickly-populated parts of two West Midland towns last night. All quickly controlled. High explosive bombs also fell. (<I>Birmingham Gazette</I>, Tuesday 19th November 1940)
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;PRIESTS PUT OUT AN OIL BOMB. Two priests in a Roman Catholic presbytery jumped out of bed and tackled an oil bomb which fell on to their bedroom during Monday night&rsquo;s raid in a West Midland town. A third priest, asleep downstairs, knew nothing of the fire above. Hearing only the crash of bombs, he pulled the bed-clothes over his head, &ldquo;expecting,&rdquo; (s he told a reporter) &ldquo;the end any minute.&rdquo; The upper floor of the presbytery was burnt out. A bomb demolished part of a school a few yards away, but the church, on the other side of the house, was untouched. Some houses in the vicinity were wrecked, but most of their occupants were rescued. The stairs of a doctor&rsquo;s house were blown away and he had to descend from his bedroom via a ladder into the garden. (<I>Birmingham Gazette</I>, Wednesday 20th November 1940)</P>

<H2>We are bombed out
</H2>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We were bombed out last night. The bombs fell all night. When we crawled out from under the stairs I could see the sky. The front of the piano was on the other side of the room. There was rubble and bricks and broken glass everywhere. We have lost everything but God has kept us all safe. It was a land-mine. We heard it coming down. Daddy was holding me and Mammy was holding Clarice, and Daddy was holding a string tied to the door.  After the All Clear we crawled out from under the stairs, There was a hole in the ceiling and I could see the sky. We walked up Belchers Lane in our night clothes with other clothes on top and have come to Granma and Grandad&rsquo;s [23 Pretoria Road]. Mammy &amp; Daddy have put our clothes and a few things in the front room. Today Daddy and Mammy went back to the house to get some more things. [661 have been killed in the raid.]</P>

<P><table><tr><td width=5% bgcolor="#ff99ff"> &nbsp; </td><td>
The Raid lasted over 9&frac12; hours. The Alert was sounded at 6.50 p.m. and the All Clear at 4.29am. At 9.25 p.m. the B.S.A., Armoury Road was hit and 50 workers were killed as the five-storey New Building collapsed. Lucas&rsquo;s and G.E.C. were also hit and many other factories, shops, schools, churches and thousands of homes. The Malt Shovel public house in John Bright Street was totally destroyed and the nearby Futurist cinema severely damaged. Railway lines were blocked and New Street station closed. 19 buses and 10 trams were damaged in the streets, 18 parachute mines fell (4 unexploded), 677 high-explosives (48 unexploded), 243 sets of incendiary bombs and 17 oil bombs. 450 people have been killed and 540 seriously injured CHECK.
&nbsp; &nbsp;<B>A formation of Heinkels of Kampfgruppe 100 loaded with baskets of incendiaries took off in the early evening. They followed a radio beam directed across the English Channel north to Birmingham. Just south of the city two other beams intersected the main beam. At the first of these the aircraft had to be kept rigidly to the exact course, height and speed. At the second intersection the bomb-handling mechanism was triggered automatically. The incendiary bombs lit up the whole city so that it was clearly visible to the bomber planes which followed. The main waves of bombers were briefed to attack the industrial targets in the heart of the city. Their approach was picked up by 19 members of the Observer Corps on the south coast soon after 6 p.m. and the information passed to R.A.F. Fighter headquarters. The course of the planes was plotted and a yellow warning sent to the Central Control of the A.R.P. Centre in Edmund Street and to the War Room at Digbeth Police Station. At 6.50 p.m. Fighter Command sent the red warning for sirens to be sounded all over the city. 369 Heinkels, Junkers and Dorniers took part in the raid. They were loaded with nearly 400 tons of high explosive bombs and 18 parachute mines. city All units of Luftflotten II and III were engaged in the raids against Coventry and Birmingham.</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp;MIDLAND NIGHT AIR BATTLE. There were raids in the West and East Midlands last night. Shortly after dusk wave after wave of enemy bombers flew over an East Midland town, heading South. They were met by intense A.A. fire and searchlights. The attacks were concentrated in one area where there were terrific explosions every second for a long period. People collected on a hill top to watch a fierce night air battle. Incendiary bombs were dropped on many districts on the outskirts of a West Midland town. Fires were soon under control. Among the fatalities was one caused by an incendiary. High explosives were also dropped in two parts of the town and in a nearby country village. A bomb fell in a park of a neighbouring town. Other rural area also reported fires due to incendiaries, and whistling bombs were stated to have been dropped. (<I>Birmingham Gazette</I>, Thursday 21st November 1940)
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;SKY AS BRIGHT AS DAY. For the first hours of the raid there were few moments when the drone of large numbers of planes, the fall of the bombs, and the whistle and crash of A.A. guns could not be heard. The sky was continually lit up by the flash of guns, bursting shells and bombs. Glares from a number of fires lit up the sky until it was almost as bright as day, and even then one could occasionally see the white light of a parachute flare as it swayed slowly groundwards. (<I>Birmingham Gazette</I>, Thursday 21st November 1940)</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;<B>BIG-BOMB RAID FAILS. HOMES GO &mdash; ANDERSONS SAVE FAMILIES.</B> Bombs of a particularly heavy calibre were dropped during a raid on a West Midland town on Wednesday night, but although considerable damage was caused to house property casualties were relatively light. A bus depot was struck and some vehicles damaged, but although ,many people had taken refuge in a shelter there, only one man was hurt &mdash; and he suffered only minor cuts and shock. Glass from the buses was strewn over a wide area, but the majority of vehicles will soon be ready for service again. Mr. L.H. Bonsfield, an air raid warden who was on duty outside the depot, told a reporter: &ldquo;It was like a terrific thunder-clap. I threw myself into the gutter, and I don&rsquo;t know how I escaped being hit by flying glass. A few seconds later there was another explosion, but I did not hear the bomb come down.&rdquo; Many houses in a working-class district were demolished, and many more were badly damaged, but so far as has been ascertained there was only one fatal casualty. There were some injuries &mdash; in the main these were minor cuts and shock. Residents in the neighbourhood, which had previously suffered bomb damage, were almost without exception in shelters, which gave them complete protection. Most remarkable were the escapes of a number of families in Anderson shelters grouped in the only available space in the area. Although the bomb fell only a few yards away and tons of debris were hurled over the shelters, there was no case of serious hurt. (<I>Birmingham Gazette</I>, Friday 22nd November 1940)</P>

<P><B>BIRMINGHAM BARRAGE &ldquo;HELL</B>,&rdquo; SAY NAZIS. <B>&ldquo;500 BOMBERS IN RAID.&rdquo;</B> Here is the story of how the German claim to have raided Birmingham on Tuesday night, as told by two pilots over the German radio:</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;<B> &ldquo;We were met by a terrific barrage,&rdquo;</B> said one. <B>&ldquo;The British had apparently learned the lesson of Coventry. Shells burst round the machine all the time. The guns were spitting fire from everywhere. It was hell. The searchlights caught us a number of times, but we were able to dodge them. In the centre of Birmingham was already a fierce fire, while some 25 separate fires could be seen. We could distinguish a burning factory, and the skeleton of a collapsed gasometers. We dropped our bombs on our target &mdash; a large factory &mdash; and turned back at once.&rdquo;</B></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; A second pilot said: <B>&ldquo;We started in pitch darkness, but approaching Birmingham the clouds gradually opened up. When we reached the city we could see it clearly under us. The British anti-aircraft guns were firing like mad, and a huge number of searchlights pierced the sky. The British were using every kind of gun, heavy and light.&rdquo;</B></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; Berlin officials claimed that considerably more than 500 planes, chiefly Junkers 88s, took part in the attack on Birmingham. The German News Agency&rsquo;s latest pronouncement is:&mdash; <B>&ldquo;Thousands upon thousands of incendiaries were dropped, and fires thus caused were so gigantic that they covered entire factories and houses, and finally entire rows of streets, while countless smaller fires were blazing.&rdquo;</B> Although the Agency had previously reported that the anti-aircraft fire was weak, it later said: <B>&ldquo;The British defence by anti-aircraft fire and searchlights was strong and continuous, but absolutely unsuccessful. Single planes started the attack, and this was followed by repeated mass-bombing by close formations. Every method of attack was used, including dive-bombing and the glide approach.&rdquo;</B></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Berlin newspaper, <I>Der Angriff</I>, had this comment to make: <B>&ldquo;England will pay bitterly for last night&rsquo;s attack on Berlin. King George, the second Coventry will not be the last.&rdquo;</B> The German propaganda machine yesterday described one West Midlands town as having been &ldquo;Coventrated.&rdquo; If the German mean that the people had borne a very noisy ordeal with courage, then they are quite right.

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp;MIDLANDS&rsquo; BIGGEST RAID. The West Midlands last night had its heaviest raid of the war. Wave after wave of enemy planes flew high over one town, dropping incendiary and high-explosive bombs. Hundreds of fires were caused and the defence services worked at tremendous pressure. In several towns bombs fell on public and municipal buildings, but in most cases the fires were soon under control. A hospital, a church, a school and two convents were bombed, but blocks of humble homes again bore the brunt and many shops were hit. Many residential areas were showered with incendiaries, and one district, which has suffered in several raids, was again bombed. In another district bombs fell in the grounds of a mental hospital. A gas main fractured in one town blazed furiously. Later in the raid bombs were dropped in the park of a castle; and one explosion in a Midland town brought hundreds of tons of masonry hurtling down. And hour after hour incendiaries caused fresh fires. Another West Midland town was luckier. Bombs were dropped but they fell mostly on allotments and fields. Two wardens were injured by exploding incendiary bombs in another town. Five high-explosive bombs fell on a fourth town, demolishing four houses in a working-class district. All the occupants were in their shelters and there were no casualties. Bombs were also dropped in rural area. The raid, which began after dusk, lasted for some hours. A.A. fire and search-lights forced the planes high. (<I>Birmingham Gazette</I>, Saturday 23rd November 1940)
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;HOW WE BOMBED BIG CITIES. More German Boasts<B>. &ldquo;Attacks by German bomber units on Thursday night were directed against London and the British industrial and armament centres in the Midlands and on the West Coast,&rdquo;</B> the official German news agency said yesterday. <B>&ldquo;Bombs of all calibres were dropped on London, Birmingham, Coventry, Bristol and Southampton. Several fires in these towns indicated the success of the raid. Further details of damage done to targets are not yet available.&rdquo; (<I></B>Birmingham Gazette</I>, Saturday 23rd November 1940)</P>

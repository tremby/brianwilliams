<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. this morning we had rifle drill and then L.M.G. instruction.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon Donald [Tipper] &amp; I played for the House 2nd XI v Porter&rsquo;s. Porter&rsquo;s batting first scored 82. Donald only bowled three balls and got a wicket for no runs. We scored 52, Donald got 3 and I got 5 before I was caught. Had we had a full team (only 9 turned up) we might easily have won. The same thing happened last week v Leeds&rsquo; when we lost by 10 runs.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;England beat The Rest by an innings &amp; 89 runs.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Scripture [first period, with Mr. Kay] we have finished St. Mark Chapter 14. In <I>Strife</I> [second period, English, with Mr. Vaughan] I am reading the part of Henry Thomas.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time I played cricket. We have a wide wicket &amp; only a thin stick as bat &amp; have to bat left-handed as well, so generally a side of 4 doesn&rsquo;t hit more than about 12. We enjoy it all the more though, especially as we can have five &ldquo;Test Matches&rdquo;. Today I got 0, 4, 1, 2, 5. Hat tricks are not at all uncommon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing else happened all day.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I spent over two hours doing prep, including a 2&ndash;page essay for French: &ldquo;Le Camping&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At school in Physics we are doing experiments in light. I worked with Renton today.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad today bought me a cycle frame. We already had a couple of wheels so we went down to Halfords [Warwick Road] &amp; Dad got a couple of tyres &amp; inner-tubes. Later we cycled [I on Bob&rsquo;s bike] to a shop in Sparkhill &amp; got some handlebars &mdash; white-covered plastic, and a chain wheel. [I am a bit disappointed because I really want dropped handlebars like all the other boys have on their Raleigh bicycles, but these are straight. Dad seems to think they are &ldquo;safer&rdquo;, and the man in the shop agrees, but I just know the boys at school are going to laugh.] Now I need a saddle, chain, and white metal mudguards.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We spent all this evening putting the parts together.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to Cubs as usual. We had a short game of cricket then issued out Gala tickets.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went in shorts again today. In Physics we are studying convex and concave mirrors. [I remember the difference because a concave mirror is &ldquo;caved in&rdquo;.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I played cricket at dinner time as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Several records were broken today. Hutchings got 34 (highest individual score) out of our side&rsquo;s 70 (highest score). We won by 50 runs: biggest victory. The best bowling record is held by Mercer &mdash; 4 wickets in 4 balls for no runs.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school I went to under XV [<I>sic</I>] nets.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Maths we are doing Trigonometry again. In J.T.C. we did loading from low cover and rifle drill.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I played for the House v Williams&rsquo; 2nd XI. Williams&rsquo; scored 137 for 5 dec. (Harris 41), then we were all out for 9 runs, Harris taking 7 [wickets] for 8 runs including 3 wickets in our 3 balls. I was given out off a &ldquo;bump ball&rdquo; without scoring, even though I had survived nearly four overs, not that I was likely to score a century!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got home for 6.15 and did well over three hours prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been looking forward to today for ages now. My second broadcast! From 1.30 to about 4.30 4.30 we did rehearsals, signed autographs &amp; had tea.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I used my new Autograph Book and it has been signed by David Scott-Daniell (editor), Peggy Bacon (producer), Michael Grayson (announcer), Patrick Wells, Brenda Radbourne, David R.

Oakley (visitor) and Philip Dudley, The only person who didn&rsquo;t sign my autograph book was Lorna Martin. I met John Young, David Brown, Jean Lester and Brenda Radbourne on &ldquo;Midland Magazine&rdquo; No. 24 in November.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The broadcast was from Studio 2. I was fourth on the programme, reading &ldquo;The Cat and the Mouse&rdquo;, a short story by a John Draper. It lasted about one minute or just over. I didn&rsquo;t make any mistakes fortunately.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Michael Grayson [who is in V.B. at school] introduced the programme. As in my previous broadcast, we each got up from our seats just before the person in front of us finished. Really, broadcasting is great fun. Nick Capaldi, playing his Accordion, finished the programme [and wrote his autograph on a separate page. Before leaving the studio] I received a cheque for 10/6d.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the afternoon I did quite a lot of prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I cut part of the lawn and watered the garden. With the hot weather continuing, all the plants are growing rapidly and several are now in flower. We could do with some rain however.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I played for the House 2nd XI v Biggs&rsquo; 2nd XI. We put Biggs&rsquo; in to bat &amp; they scored 90. I took one catch. We put up a good first wicket stand but there was a collapse. I went in No. 9 and still 40 runs were needed. I suddenly decided that the bowling was not all it should have been &amp; hit 24 (17 in one over). This included five fours. [Graham] Tayar, after a good innings, was eventually out at the other end, but Hughes came in and made the winning hit &amp; we had won by 2 wickets! My (very lucky) 24 not out was the highest score in the match.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The 1st team won by six wickets. My scores this season are now 4 n.o., 0, 5, 0, 24 n.o.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Prayers are of course being held in the Quadrangle while the examinations are in progress in Big School.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning we had our French exam which everyone agreed was very stiff. This afternoon we had Arithmetic which was not so bad. I may just about get 50% in the Maths.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I spent doing revision and I also blancoed my gaiters &amp; belt and pressed my uniform. Tomorrow in J.T.C. we shall have an inspection.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There was no exam today fortunately but worse still I heard I had got only 30% in the Geography exam. I am bottom of the block as well.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In English the School Captain [G.F.B. Laughland] talked to us about the Korean situation. On Sunday Communist troops from N. Korea advanced into territory of the Korean Republic. The Security Council called for immediate cessation of hostilities. On Monday the S. Korea Govt. was reported to have left Seoul, then on Tuesday, President Truman ordered U.S.A. air &amp; sea forces to support the Korean Republic Govt. troops &amp; to protect Formosa.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent all afternoon and evening doing revision.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning we had a 2&frac12; hour History exam &amp; I doubt whether I shall get 20%.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time Donald &amp; I went hunting for wild flowers for my collection &amp; we got quite a few. [I am pressing them in the book I have made for them].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had normal lessons as usual this afternoon. I came home on the Special Bus.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I have done more revision &amp; pressed my wild flowers. It has been a lovely day &amp; in the garden there are lots of flowers including roses, poppies, cornflowers, stocks, feather-few [<I>sic</I>, feverfew], geraniums [i.e. pelargoniums] and others.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My letter was published in this week&rsquo;s <I>The Scout</I> under &ldquo;Pack News&rdquo;.</P>

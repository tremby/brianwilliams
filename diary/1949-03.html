<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Back to School again this morning. 1st Period all forms went to form-rooms to buy dinner tickets for the rest of the term. Most boys buy about twenty tickets at least.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After Special Bus I came straight home.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon it started to snow but I went down the village twice. After doing prep I played out until 6.30pm. and went to Scouts at 7.30. We did P.T., Wrestling and I played Scrimmage. I arrived home at 9.40pm.</P>

<P>P.S. We had pancakes today [as it was Shrove Tuesday].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I was late starting out (as usual). I went by 31A bus almost to the College Arms and waited for the Special Bus there. When I got on it the usual cries of horror (?) greeted me. &ldquo;Here he (it) is.&rdquo;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I went down to play football but after my first kick a pulled thigh muscle in my right leg hurt so terribly that I went in goal for most of the remaining time. I also cleaned my rifle.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the S.B. Tonight I blancoed my gaiters and belt.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The rain was pouring down when I set out for school this morning &mdash; in fact it was still raining at 1 o&rsquo;clock so I spent the dinner hour in the library doing prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon we had a History Test. I would not be surprised if I get a detention for it, though I spent over two preps on it.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual I came home on the S.B.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight having finished all my homework I completed my talk which I am giving tomorrow (and which won&rsquo;t be any good anyway). Mam and Dad are at the pictures. [<I>Sitting Pretty</I> and <I>Winner Take All</I> are on at the Warwick, and <I>The Winslow Boy</I> at the Olton.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is now just past 8.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[We have been having trouble with the coal we get from Slater &amp; Taylor, as it doesn&rsquo;t burn very well and there is a lot of slack. So many people are complaining and changing to the Co-Op or other company that the Birmingham Coal Merchants&rsquo; Association has put a huge advert in tonight&rsquo;s <I>Mail</I>, asking people to stay with their present supplier. I see that Slater &amp; Taylor are among the 150 listed; they have a wharf at Curzon Street.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went to town [on the 31A bus and then by 70, 71 or 72 tram from Navigation Street]. When I got off the tram [at Edgbaston Park Road] the University clock was just striking 9.15am. Did I run? I just threw my cap, mac and satchel onto my peg and raced into the Choir Gallery five seconds before 3rd Bell.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I gave my talk on &ldquo;Greyhounds&rdquo; in English. It wasn&rsquo;t very good, but I could have gone on for at least another fifteen minutes. [Mr. Parry jokingly asked me to point out where a greyhound&rsquo;s loins were; the boys laughed, and I was embarrassed.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It started to snow at 10.20am. I did not go to the match [against Bolton Wanderers, and wasn&rsquo;t sorry when we heard on the football results that lt was a goalless draw. Blues kept the same team as last week]. The snow did not stop [and only 21,000 were there].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I went to the Olton cinema to see Robert Donat, Cedric Hardwicke and Margaret Leighton in <I>The Winslow Boy</I>. It was an excellent film [based on the true story of a Naval cadet who is expelled for stealing a postal order; his father spends all he has on proving his innocence].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The snow was still falling on my way home at 9.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not wake until 9.30am this morning because I did not get into bed until 10.30pm last night. During the night some more snow fell &mdash; a total of four inches since yesterday morning.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual Dad and I took Ginger for a run. She likes the snow.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I did a bit of prep and tonight I played &ldquo;Crib&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is now 8.15pm. After I have had my bath I am going to bed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened at school today. I had as usual two Choir practices. In Scripture [last] period I collected 7/6d Cot-Fund, probably owing to [<I>sic</I>] my changed tactics in noting [in a book] how much everyone gave.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home via town and arrived at five o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I have been doing homework. I made out a House Choir notice also, and now I am listening to &ldquo;The Man in Black&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I just caught the S.B. this morning. I do believe that if I get up at 6.30am I might not have to run so much every day.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing particular happened at school and I was back home again for twenty past one.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon when I had done prep I played out for a little and went to Scouts at 7.30pm. We did mostly mapwork.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I caught the S.B. in time this morning. School ended for the day at 12.25pm &mdash; it was a half-holiday [given us by the Head].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to go to the Organ recital by [the City organist] George Thalben-Ball, Mus.D., A.R.C.M., F.R.C.O., at the Town Hall. The recital included <I>Fantasia and Fugue in G</I> (Parry), <I>Chorale No. 3 in A minor</I> (Cesar Franck) and <I>Toccata</I> (Maurice Durufl&eacute;).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I arrived home at 3.0pm and did prep for the rest of the afternoon until five o&rsquo;clock. Then I played outside for an hour.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I caught the S.B. at Shaftmoor Lane. Nothing much happened at school. In J.T.C. I went shooting. I may classify as a 1st Class Shot by 1952. [I am too nervous to hold the rifle steady.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home from school via town. This afternoon I finished off what prep I had left &mdash; I did it nearly all yesterday. I went out to play at 4.30pm and stayed out until 6.30.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is now eight o&rsquo;clock. I am going to bed soon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not do Gym, 3rd Period this morning. My leg is almost better now after a fortnight or more. If it is alright on Tuesday I hope to get some standards.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Parry is going into hospital again, so we shall be having a new form master.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I collected my Bus fare allowance in the Dinner Hour (I did not have school-dinner). I also played football for 15 mins. I scored one goal though I was in goal for 12 mins.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Sacret took the History period. After school I came home on the Special Bus and had a haircut.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I have been doing Maths prep. for an hour and a half.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Crow took us for English this morning [in the absence of Mr. Parry]. We had to write an essay. We did not have a Chemistry test (Yippee!) but we did have a Maths test.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town and bought my copy of the <I>Geographical Magazine</I> [at W.H. Smith&rsquo;s in Corporation Street. I wanted to get the <I>National Geographic</I> but it is available only by subscription.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I arrived home at half-past one.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the afternoon I listened to the Wolves v Newcastle Utd. match. I also painted a picture which took me an hour and a half.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I went out to get a <I>Sports Argus</I> but I was too late. [There is always a queue for the <I>Argus</I> as it carries dramatic reports &mdash; and action pictures &mdash; of Birmingham City&rsquo;s and Aston Villa&rsquo;s matches, but paper is in short supply and a lot of people cannot get a copy. The <I>Argus</I> is published by the Birmingham Gazette and Despatch company and printed on pink paper. The <I>Birmingham Mail</I> publishes its own blue sports edition, but there is no doubt which is more popular.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 7.45pm I went to the Library to renew two books and I got Gunby Hadath&rsquo;s <I>Brent of Gatehouse</I> for myself.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon we went [to] the Mission. Ron Tilsley was the speaker. When we arrived home I finished my Chemistry Notes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I played &ldquo;Crib&rdquo; until just after 8.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was foggy when I went to school this morning.

[John came with his train set nine weeks ago.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I should love to have a Hornby Dublo but they are very expensive and I would never ask for one. &ldquo;Hornby&rdquo; is the name of Frank Hornby (1863&ndash;1936) who started the Meccano sets in 1901, and &ldquo;Dublo&rdquo; means &ldquo;OO gauge&rdquo;. Meccano started making Dinky toys in 1931, but they were not called that until 1934. Their factory is at Binns Lane, Liverpool. I put my Dinky toys with the trains to make an attractive lay-out as they are manufactured to the same scale, 1:72.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We played out from 4.45pm till 5.30 and then we all had tea. We played together for the rest of the evening. John went home at 8.30 and Kipper just after.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up at 8.30am this morning, took Ginger out, made a pot of tea, and then Clarice and I took Ginger for a walk as far as the Greet and back. We took the dog to the park as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon we went to the Mission. Mr. Curtis was the speaker.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I have been doing prep and also played &ldquo;Crib&rdquo; with Dad.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Geography at school this morning Mr. Whalley let us have an epidiascope show of North America. I supplied several photos. In Chemistry we did our own experiments as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After Choir Practice I played football and scored two goals. I came home on the Special.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;From 4.45pm onwards I have been doing prep nearly all the time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad had all his top teeth out this afternoon. I certainly don&rsquo;t envy him.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened at school today. I came home at 1.15pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I did homework until 4.30. Then I played out for a short time and went to get Dad&rsquo;s medicine from Boots&rsquo;. I had to wait for an hour.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is now 8.15. I am listening to <I>Much Binding in the Marsh</I> with Sam Costa etc. etc., and Richard Murdoch and Kenneth Horne.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up at 7.0am this morning in order to set out for our J.T.C. Field Day at 8 o&rsquo;clock. I met Hopkins in the village, so we went to Rubery together and arrived there at about 9.15.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our first bearing we had to reach was 432976, a wind-pump which we reached easily enough. We then proceeded to Chadwick Manor &mdash; 427965, 436962 Beacon Hill, 453960 Cofton Hackett, 454956 and 449971, and finally back to Rubery.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We ate our dinners at about 12.30 at a point overlooking Bittell Reservoir. When we got back to school at 3.45 we had tea in the dining-hall and then there was a C.C.F. Variety Show in Big School. I arrived home at 7 o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I have blancoed my gaiters &amp; belt.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. this morning we had the Docker Cup Competition for turnout and drill. I did not take part for the platoon because I had not really had enough experience [having joined a term late] and I did not want to let the platoon down; I doubt whether I should have made much difference &mdash; they weren&rsquo;t in the first six.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On my way home I went to the Library and got <I>Schoolboy Grit</I> by Gunby Hadath.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am writing all this a day late &mdash; 8 o&rsquo;clock on Friday evening in fact. I went to bed at half past seven. I felt tired.</P>

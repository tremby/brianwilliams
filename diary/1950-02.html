<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of today it has rained.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Geography today we had a test.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 1.15 Don Tipper and I went for a short walk though it was raining.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In English we started an essay entitled:&mdash; &ldquo;How I would vote in the General Election&rdquo;, but otherwise nothing happened at school.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I did quite a lot of homework, listened to a play on the radio and had a bath before going to bed. I also blancoed gaiters, belt and musketry order.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I just missed the Special Bus this morning so I had to go on the 1A with [David] Alexander who lives at 47 Oxford Road]. I ran as hard as I was able up Park Vale and managed to get into prayers. Dr. Willis Grant asked Don Tipper and I [<I>sic</I>] to sing Alto as from tomorrow.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Vaughan was absent today so Mr. Sacret took us for <I>Julius Caesar</I>. In Gym [after break, with Mr. King] I am now in Team 1. We practised hand springs &amp; then played netball. I scored the winning goal for our side.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time I played football and then we had a History test. Otherwise nothing happened.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school I went to a Geographical Society meeting. Two sound films &ldquo;Soil-Erosion&rdquo; and &ldquo;Australia&rdquo; were shown.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam &amp; Dad have gone to the cinema [to see <I>Master of Lassie</I> (U) and <I>Whistling in Dixie</I> (U) at the Warwick]. I have done prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing else happened at school.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon Dad and I went to the B&rsquo;ham City v Arsenal match. Blues:&mdash; Merrick; Green, Jennings; Boyd, Badham, Dorman; Stewart, Jordan, Dailey, Brennan, Berry. Birmingham scored first through Dailey &amp; led by that goal at the interval. Arsenal equalised through Goring but Blues won with a penalty goal by Brennan. Their record is now:&mdash;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up first this morning and lit the fire. Later on in the morning I took Ginger for a short walk &amp; Bob and I also gave her a run in the park. It seems strange, quite unbelievable, that last Sunday we were taking both Ginger and Tess to the park. We all miss Tess very much indeed. [We had her for only 5&frac12; months and she was barely 8 months old].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I did some prep. and also made a new folder for my pad. [I also kept today&rsquo;s leaf torn off the calendar. The verses I write in my diary each evening are taken from elsewhere.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I finished my homework.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Physics today [third period, with Mr. Gess our form master], Mr. (Spike) Jackson came in to say that someone had locked his case and he was unable to open it. It seems that Winrow had a key of his own which he found fitted the case so he locked it for a lark, at the cost of two pages [an essay].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There was no Choir Practice so I played football. I worked with Chadwin in Chemistry [the first two periods of the afternoon, again with Mr. Gess].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school I had an extra mapwork parade for J.T.C. I got home for 5.30.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happened this afternoon and I came home on the Special Bus as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Harris came for dinner.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I did a bit of prep and got my J.T.C. things ready.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon our House 2nd team was defeated by Leeds&rsquo; by 14 points to 8pts. The match was played in torrential rain which did not stop once. I was Hooker as usual. The 1st team also lost 0&ndash;6.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I spent between two and three hours doing French, Maths, Physics, Chemistry &amp; History homework.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;A new master took us for Geography today and in History we had a short factual test.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I was one of a party from the Railway &amp; Model Engineering Society to visit Saltley L.M.R. Motive Power Depot (21A). [We went to town on the tram as usual, then caught a No 8 (or 10) tram in Martineau Street, got off at Duddeston Mill Road, crossed over, and found the shed entrance just past the bridge.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had a very interesting time. I cabbed 2&ndash;6&ndash;0 No. 43043 and &ldquo;Jubilee&rdquo; Class No. 45581 <I>Bihar and Orissa</I>. An interesting visitor to Saltley was E.R. No. 61204 which has appeared recently in New Street [Station]. I noticed No. 22853 inside the sheds. This is supposed to have been withdrawn from service.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had a very interesting time. I cabbed 2-6-0 No. 43043 and &ldquo;Jubilee&rdquo; Class No. 45581 Bihar and Orissa. An interesting visitor to Saltley was E.R. No. 61204 which has appeared recently in New Street [Station].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I noticed No. 22853 inside the sheds. This is supposed to have been withdrawn from service [but I expect it was waiting to be broken up. It is a former Midland Railway 2F 0-6-0 built in 1868 with double frames, later rebuilt with a Belpaire boiler. 22853 is its former L.M.S. number &mdash; evidently it was withdrawn from service before receiving its British Railways number, which would have been 58112. There is a photo of 22853 in the Ian Allan <I>ABC of British Railways Locomotives Part 3</I>, which I bought last September.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home via Alum Rock. Our old home [23 Belchers Lane, from which we were bombed out on the night of 19th&ndash;20th November 1940] still has its red &ldquo;Cardinaled&rdquo; walls [&ldquo;Cardinal&rdquo; being the name of the red polish Mam used on the bricks]. Everywhere still seems the same as it did ten years ago.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I caught a bus along Bordesley Green &amp; [got off at Bordesley then walked up Sandy Lane and] caught the 31A at Camp Hill.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[In December the Ian Allan <I>ABC Locoshed Book Part 3</I> is going to be published, detailing the shed allocation of every London Midland Region locomotive at 9th September 1950. Serendipity! Saltley&rsquo;s allocation is:&mdash;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing unusual happened at school today. In J.T.C. we did drill and then duties of sentries.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon our 2nd XII match v Burgess&rsquo; 2nd was cancelled, so I was touch judge for the 1st team who lost by 12pts to 6.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Before the game I had a look at the river at the back of the [Eastern Road playing] field. The recent heavy rain has swollen up the river and washed away part of the bank, making it a bit wider.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I received two Official Guides to Norwich and Ely, which I sent for as we have been doing East Anglia in Regional Geography. The Ely Guide is an old one as it gives the railway fares from London (Liverpool Street or Kings Cross):&mdash; 1st Class Single, 20/1d; 3rd Class Single, 12/7d; 1st Class Monthly Return, 25/2d; 3rd Class Monthly Return, 16/9d); and states that &ldquo;These Fares are increased from 1st October, 1947.&rdquo;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have also obtained the 1950 Official Guide to Lowestoft &amp; Oulton Broad, beautifully produced, with sepia and full-colour photographs, by Jarrold &amp; Sons Ltd., Norwich. They print Magna Chrome books and picture postcards, and have a place in London Road, Lowestoft.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Head [Mr. T.E.B. Howarth] gave us a half holiday today &amp; hoped that we would take the opportunity to watch the 1st XV match between Porter&rsquo;s and Dunt&rsquo;s. I went to see the match of course.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There were about 200 odd spectators. Dunt&rsquo;s won by 22 points to 19. The game was fairly even &amp; Porter&rsquo;s led by 16 pts to 11 at half time, then Dunt&rsquo;s got going &amp; scored three tries, one being converted. Porter&rsquo;s never really recovered until the last ten minutes when they scored a consolation goal.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There has been a lot of excitement at school today as the election results came through &amp; were posted on the Prefects&rsquo; Notice Board. Labour led the Conservatives by 60 at 9 o&rsquo;clock but their lead steadily diminished to 25 by 3.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came straight home on the S.B. and took down the results as they came over the radio. (Yardley Results Page 1 [of this Diary]). Once the Conservatives were only 5 behind but Labour pulled up. At 7.15 Lab had 311 seats, Cons. 284, Libs 7 &amp; Speaker. As Labour led by 27 and there was only another 22 results to come the Socialists had won the election.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today was our half-term holiday, so this morning at 9.30 I went to play football with Kipper, Phil, [Ian] Hunt &amp; 12 others at Jubilee Park [Solihull]. We had goal nets &amp; dressing rooms. The first game we lost 7&ndash;3. (I got a penalty). In the second game &mdash; K.E.S. v the rest &mdash; we won 3&ndash;2 and I scored two. The pitch was a quagmire and it was bitterly cold.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I did two paintings.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight Dad and I went for a walk with Brownhound.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The state of the parties is at present:&mdash;</P>

<P>Labour 314, Conserv. 294, Liberals 9, Irish Nat. 2. There are still four more results to come. [The result for Yardley is:&mdash;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad and I took Ginger for a run in the park before breakfast today and then spent all day laying the path across the garden. We have not yet finished the path. We dug up a lot of house bricks from out of the flower bed. The snag is though, what can we do with them? There is no room in the garden anywhere.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I did quite a lot of homework.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I took Clarice and Julia up town. In the Bull Ring we saw a foreigner who stood bare-footed on nails and lay on the nails with six people standing on his chest, a total weight of 63 stones. He also ate fire.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon Mam took us to the Warwick. We saw <I>Three Godfathers</I> in Technicolor which I thought was rather a poor film [about three outlaws escaping across the desert who discover a baby &mdash; terribly depressing]. It was a &ldquo;U&rdquo; film while <I>Kid Glove Killer</I>, an excellent detective film, received an &ldquo;A&rdquo; Certificate &amp; was much more suitable for Universal Exhibition.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I wrote up Chemistry notes &amp; did other prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After House meetings today we went to form rooms to buy dinner tickets. Third period we had a Chemistry test.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I entered in the Junior (up to 16&frac12;) Cross-Country Run over 2 miles. I finished 60th out of 94. I did the distance in just under 19 minutes and got the standard. I was 5th in the House. Copland&rsquo;s got 12 standards more than the other Houses (Next best was Williams&rsquo;s, who won most points, with ten.)</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I found a photo of Dad when he ran cross-country about 1930 with Small Heath Harriers.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got home I went down the village.</P>

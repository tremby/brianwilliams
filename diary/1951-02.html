<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was fourth after about 400 yards but just managed to keep well to the front so that I actually finished twelfth or thirteenth. As I did the distance in fifty five minutes I got both the Open (60 mins) and Intermediate (65 minutes) standards. My time last year was 56&frac12; minutes. I should imagine that about two hundred took part. R.St.J. Glydon and J.D. Waterstreet tied for first place in the Open while N.C. Brown won the Intermediate with R.B.W. Price in second place.</P>

The match started early as the pitch was required for another game afterwards. Owing to the early kick-off I was unable to get the forwards down beforehand and after some shuffling about I put Griffin and Trow as front row with me. We were up against a much better &amp; heavier pack though and we lost by 14 pts to nil.</P>

The article was very well illustrated by a dozen photographs showing the Common Room, Prefects&rsquo; Room &amp; School Captain&rsquo;s Study. Then there was a general view taken from the 325 feet high University tower, a photo of the Milk Bar, Library and Fives Courts. Then there was one of Rem. [Remove] C. doing French, an U.M.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon Dad and I went to St Andrew&rsquo;s to see B&rsquo;ham City play Bristol City in the 5th Round of the FA Cup.

Bristol: Sullivan; Guy, Bailey; Peacock, Roberts, Beasley (player-manager); Williams, Eisentrager, Clark, Rodgers, Rudkin. It was a disappointing match however. There were actually forty fouls throughout the game. The goals were scored by Stewart and Trigg, one in each half. The official attendance was 47,831.</P>

<P>What an exciting day! B&rsquo;ham City v Manchester United. Trigg loses the toss, kicks off. The ball goes to Boyd, he puts it out to Stewart on the right. A couple of headers and the ball is at the feet of Higgins, 20 yards out. A glorious shot into the top corner of the net and Blues are one up within 22 seconds. United are rattled and are rarely in the game then. Blues keep pressing but can&rsquo;t score, though they are by far the better team. Their half-backs are brilliant, the defensive tackling terrific. It is a fierce tussle but with plenty of good football. The 50,000 crowd are always afraid United will score. But the final whistle goes and Blues are in the Semi-Final!</P>

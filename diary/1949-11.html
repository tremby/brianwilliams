<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happened at school again today. I cam straight home and did some homework this afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight Mrs. Gray, Mrs. Leek and Mrs. Holliday came round to discuss tomorrow&rsquo;s court case.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My cold was worse this morning so I stayed at home.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the Court case the solicitor for Mrs. Jenkins did not turn up as he had to deal with another case. Anyway the case has been postponed until next Wednesday.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent the morning doing some homework.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I fiddled about with my Chemistry set.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I read and listened to the fourth instalment of &ldquo;Paul Temple and the Madison Mystery&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not go to school again this morning. I spent the morning lying on the settee reading.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I had to go to be tried as a reader for &ldquo;Midland Magazine&rdquo; at the B.B.C. Studios in Broad Street. Mam and I arrived there at 4.0pm and then I went into the Studio with about ten other children. Here I was given my script. It is altogether different from my original. Several paragraphs have been left out or changed. I read the script in front of a microphone &amp; Peggy Bacon said she would like me to read it on November 19th. She was listening in an adjoining room &amp; answered through a &ldquo;mike&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We got home at 6.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My cold is not yet better so I did not go to school. Mam had to go to hospital so I was was able to give Clarice &amp; Julia their dinner. I had spent the morning mostly reading a book of nursery stories [<I>The Treasure Book of Fairy Tales</I>, Juvenile Productions Ltd., London, which I was given for Christmas 1944, and still have].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I played with my chemistry set. (I have grown some good Copper Sulphate crystals the last two days). Mam got home just before 5.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual Mam and Dad have gone to the cinema &amp; Bob has gone out. [Jack Warner and Kathleen Harrison in <I>The Huggetts Abroad</I> (U) and Howard Duff in <I>Illegal Entry</I> (A) are on at the Olton; and Yvonne de Carlo in <I>Salome, Where She Danced</I> (A), and Sally Ann Howes and Guy Rolfe in <I>Fools Rush In</I> (A) at the Warwick.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today was our Half Term holiday. After breakfast I went down the village with Clarice and Julia. It was raining quite heavily. It was Poppy Day today so I bought a poppy. I also bought a battery and bulb for a torch which I had not used for at least five or six years.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The rain stopped during dinner so I went to the match on a special bus from Stoney Lane.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had a few fireworks to let off last night but we saved one or two. There were hundreds of bangers going off incessantly &mdash; we only had two, neither of which went off. [We have our own fireworks factory in Birmingham: it is Wilders&rsquo; on Warwick Road at Greet.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I got up, made a pot of tea, then took Ginger and Tess to Tyseley for a walk. Clarice and Julia came with me.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast I read <I>Paying the Price</I> by Gunby Hadath &amp; also went with Dad to give the dogs a run in the park.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I finished reading the book.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I washed up then I went down the village on Bob&rsquo;s bike again and got a book from the Library. This was another Gunby Hadath book: <I>Living Up to It</I>. As usual it was a fine book and I am looking forward to reading another G.H. story in December 1949 <I>B.O.P.</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent most of the afternoon and evening reading.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went back to school today. After hymn practice we had House meetings. This is to be the usual procedure for Tuesdays now.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;First period we went to form-rooms to buy dinner tickets.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the V.C. Science League I finished top of Div. II with 172 marks, so I am promoted to Div. I + 5 extra marks. Not only this but I am now <I>5th</I> in Div. I.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Chemistry we had a test but I had been absent &amp; had missed some of the work.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I did some homework. Mrs. Harris came. [She has given me a little book entitled <I>Come Ye Apart</I> by J.R. Miller, D.D., which I think she has had for a long time. It contains Daily Bible Readings in the Life of Christ, a page for every day of the year. I am very pleased with it and shall keep it all my life. I have inscribed it on the fly-leaf:&mdash; 8.xi.49 Brian D. Williams. Today&rsquo;s reading is headed &ldquo;The Baffled Tempter&rdquo;, based on Luke xxii.31.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today at school we went for our Mass Radiography so we missed prayers &amp; the first two periods (Physics &amp; Maths). We went by a Paid by a Special Bus to Corporation Street. We undressed to the waist, received a card which was then filled in, &amp; passed into another room. Here there was a queer apparatus &amp; a plate was placed against our chests for a few seconds. That was all.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much else happened at school.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning in the Law Courts [also in Corporation Street but further down from the Mass Radiography centre] Mrs. Jenkins piled forth a whole pile of false allegations (as was expected). Anyway, she was bound over to keep the peace for three months. [Years later Ethel F. Jenkins writes to me, we exchange letters, and I find her to be a nice person, and I am very sorry about all the unhappiness.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I received a letter from the B.B.C. with a contract for me to write a further talk [actually to broadcast the talk I have already written].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In English Mr. Vaughan read to us the final part of <I>Dauber</I> by John Masefield. In Geography Mr. Whalley showed us a film about Meteorological Instruments.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In J.T.C. we marched with the R.N. Section &amp; the Air Section up the University Drive and back &amp; then practised saluting &amp; &ldquo;eyes right/left&rdquo; etc. in readiness for the Church parade on Sunday. [Field-Marshal Montgomery was to have visited us today, and the N.C.O.s were to form a Guard of Honour, but he could not come].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I played for the House 2nds. We won our match which was v Leeds&rsquo; by 13 pts to 3. I was Hooker as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I did prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In English today I was &ldquo;Maria&rdquo; in Shakespeare&rsquo;s <I>Twelfth Night</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time I did a little job for Fred Oxley in the Music Room &amp; then did some Divinity prep. [set for us in first period] in the library.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In History I got 7/10 in a short test.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the S.B. of course.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Mam, Dad and Bob having gone out, I have done quite a lot of prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I just about managed to catch the Special Bus this morning. At school we had a half-term Physics test. I got full marks for a Maths test yesterday.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;All over the school all types of posters have been appearing advertising the School v Bromsgrove match for the Siviter-Smith Cup this afternoon. I intended to go but I have no one to go with so I changed my mind.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am writing this [additional material] on Sunday and I found out that School XV beat Bromsgrove [School] by 13 pts to 3.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening after fetching the <I>Sports Argus</I> I blancoed my gaiters and belt for Church Parade. The order will be R.N. Section, A., C., B., Coys., Air Section, led by the band.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up at the usual time this morning. Clarice and Julia both wanted to see the Parade so I took them with me. I went &amp; came back with John.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We assembled in the Drive &amp; then marched up Edgbaston Pk. Rd. to the Parish Church. The service, in which the Head spoke, lasted an hour. Colonel Docker took the Salute on the way back [and the Band &mdash; under Sgt. C.J. Latham, Drum-Major, with L/Cpl. K.A.F. Brewin leading the drummers, and Cdt. D. Yetman the buglers &mdash; gave an impressive performance.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We were back home at 2.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After prayers today the Head presented the Siviter Smith Cup to I.R. McClelland, Captain of the XV. [The advertising paid off: the school turned out in force to support the XV, and they played magnificently. G.T. Lyall scored a try, McClelland kicked a penalty, Homer got a try, and Lyall another try which Revill converted. I wish I had gone. J.D. Giles, G.T. Lyall, F.B. Revill, C.F.J. Latham and G.A. Taplin were awarded their School Colours afterwards.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had Choir Practice as usual. Nothing else happened at school and I came home on the S.B. as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I did some homework. David and his young lady [Marjorie] came just after eight o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual nothing at all happened at school. Evidently K.E.S. is not one of those schools where great thrills and adventures befall its pupils. But perhaps I&rsquo;ve been making a study of Gunby Hadath too much. [I first read his stories in <I>Boy&rsquo;s Own Paper</I> and find he used to teach Classics at Guildford Grammar School; he is about 69 now and a prolific writer.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway after school I came home through town &amp; did my Physics prep. on the 31A bus. I hope it isn&rsquo;t as bad as last week&rsquo;s Chemistry. I nearly got into a stew because a lot of tiny pieces of paper (originally my test-paper which I had torn up disgustedly) were found adorning the floor of Lecture Room 2.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I read comics, this evening I did homework.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As usual nothing happened at school. The School Captain [G.F.B. Laughland] has now made a rule that all boys bringing their own sandwiches [as I do] must eat them in Room 59.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I received a letter from the Radio Critic of the <I>Birmingham Mail</I> asking if I had a photo of myself suitable for publishing with next Monday&rsquo;s Radio Notes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I wrote a letter in reply and did some History prep.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came straight home from school, After dinner I went down the village for Mam &amp; bought myself the <I>Rover</I> and <I>Hotspur</I>. These I read in the course of the afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I got my new <I>ABC of British Railways</I> (Part 2, Southern Region) today.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school I went to the Railway and Model Engineering Society. Two films about signalling &amp; loco. repairing were shown. Donald Tipper came with me &amp; we went home together on the 1A. It was terrifically foggy.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today I shall remember for a long time to come. I arrived at the B.B.C. at 1.20 but we did not start rehearsing until about 2.30. Each of us was given a copy of the complete script. Quite a lot of minor changes were made. Some parts had to be cut out for instance.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I used the back of my 26-page script to collect autographs from David Scott-Daniell (editor), Pat Baldrey (who came with her sister), Malcolm Ridley, John Young, Donald Ridgarde, Douglas Ward, Jean Baldrey, Ivor R. Ford, Keith J. Bolden, Gillian Watts (who introduced the programme), Jack Wilson &amp; Harry Engleman (pianists) and Peggy Bacon (producer). Other children whose autographs I did not get were Pat Tovey, David Brown, Charles Butler, Jean Lester, John Hemming, Kenneth Short, Brenda Radbourne, Gerald Cowan and Pamela West, so (including myself) 18 children took part.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had tea, then in Studio 1 at 5.0pm the red light came on &amp; we were on the air. It was strangely thrilling &amp; awe inspiring. Each of us got up from our places just before the person then speaking, finished. I was tenth on the programme. I&rsquo;m glad to say I didn&rsquo;t make a mistake. I pictured Mam and Dad and Clarice &amp; Julia &amp; Bob all sitting round the Radio listening intently. I could imagine some of my School-friends &amp; perhaps nearly a million others listening. It was all very thrilling.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My talk lasted approximately two minutes ten seconds. The programme ended at about 5.45, then Jack Wilson &amp; Harry Engleman played at two pianos. Then right on the dot at 5.55pm the red light went out and it was all over. We were all given an envelope before we went out &mdash; it contained a cheque for one guinea &mdash; my first wage packet!!!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I read some of <I>The Wooden Horse</I> and then varnished part of the shed door.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When we had had tea I minced quite a large amount of bread [baked hard in the oven for the dogs&rsquo; meals]. I also took down the latest weather readings.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today was Field Day for us. I missed the S.B. &mdash; it went early. I had to call in at school to get my K.D. [khaki drill] out of my locker. I changed into it, my K.D. I mean, on the [70] tram.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We arrived at Rednal at 10.0am. Our platoon marched for about a mile &amp; a half mainly uphill. On the way I saw a Chaffinch and a Grey Squirrel. We spent the day map-reading, camouflaging ourselves and stalking, and we also did some rolling down slopes, Leopard-crawling and Monkey running. Strange that the latter should come so naturally to me.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had tea at school at 4.15pm in the Dining Hall.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I did revision of History for tomorrow&rsquo;s exam.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got on the S.B. this morning and [John] Renton gave me a &ldquo;Christmas Present&rdquo; in an envelope. I opened it warily and a paper bat flew into my face!!!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing happened at school apart from the History examination last period. I did a bit better than I expected &mdash; I got my highest mark so far this term.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I played football during the dinner hour and scored a goal as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I did some homework and blancoed my gaiters and belt.</P>

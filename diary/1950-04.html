<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;End of term again. I did not go on the S.B. today as the Choir had to meet in Edgbaston Church at 9.15 for a rehearsal. We were back however for House Meetings at 10.10 followed by break, after which we assembled in Big School for the breaking up ceremony. I had to go up to receive my K.E. Scholarship medal [one of six awarded when I passed the admission exam three years ago &mdash; the others were G.T. Bruce, A. Derbyshire, P.R. Janney, P.J. Riley and J.E. Rivers].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got home for 12.15 then I went to the Birmingham City v Newcastle United match. Result 0&ndash;2 [a disappointment after winning their last three home matches. Birmingham City:&mdash; Merrick; Badham, Jennings; Boyd, Atkins, Ferris; Stewart, Berry, Dailey, Brennan, Roberts. 30,000 were there]. Dad came with me to the match.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight after I had cycled to the Library I read until nine o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Before breakfast this morning Dad, Bob and I took Ginger for a run in the park.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As arranged, [John] Winrow called for me at 11 o&rsquo;clock and we went for a cycle ride together. It was a windy morning and showery as well. We went to Widney Manor and back though.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon there was the School service held in Edgbaston Parish Church. Mam &amp; Dad went. The Sermon was given by The Rev. Ronald Allen, M.C., M.A., Vicar of Edgbaston.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After I had blancoed gaiters and belt I looked out for the Total Eclipse of the Moon. Unfortunately the sky was clouded over but I had just one good view during totality from 8.29 to 8.59pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today all &ldquo;B&rdquo; Company took Cert. A, Part 1. We started about 9.45pm [<I>sic</I>], having been split up in sections. First we did individually, units of measure &amp; judging distance followed by &ldquo;Lying load&rdquo;. Then we described how to clean a rifle. After this we did drill, then after dinner [<I>sic</I>].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the afternoon we did various items of map reading, message-writing, duties of sentries, and sniping. The latter consisted mainly of taking cover etc. All the examiners were new to us. We had to wait some time for the result; fortunately I passed but six failed. I have got my badge.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I started to bind my <I>Meccano Magazine</I>s.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Apart from going down the village this morning I continued binding my <I>M.M.</I>&rsquo;s. Having removed the staples and advertisements &amp; having sewn the twelve issues together I put the cover on, end-papers included. I still have to obtain some materials for the spine but I have sand-papered the edges.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I sorted out all the waste paper [and took it to the salvage bin in the front drive of the house in Olton Boulevard East].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I went to Cubs as usual. I have been asked to take charge of six cubs who will compete for the District Championship on May 6th.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today Winrow and I spent at Kenilworth. We started off on our bicycles at 10.15 and it was about midday I suppose when we arrived. We had a Choc-Ice first then we went into the castle grounds and ate our sandwiches in the Keep which dates from 1180. (The Keep that is).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The next three hours or so we spent exploring or chasing each other round. The castle is an interesting place. It was founded about 1120 by Geoffrey de Clinton &amp; passed to Simon de Montfort in 1234. John of Gaunt added two towers &amp; banqueting hall.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent nearly all this morning [Good Friday] cutting the front lawn [as always with a pair of shears as we have no lawnmower]. The grass is in quite good condition &amp; shouldn&rsquo;t look too bad when it is finished.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon we all went to Cannon Hill Park [on the 1A &rsquo;bus from the village] and so Ginger Brownhound naturally came with us. It was again quite warm out in the sunshine.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Birmingham today won their first away game of the season beating Man. Utd. [at Old Trafford] 2&ndash;nil. Manchester were top of the league as well, so perhaps they [Birmingham City] will stay in Division I after all. We shall know better after playing Everton tomorrow and Man. Utd. at home on Monday.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I helped Dad in the garden.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight I went to the Warwick Cinema [at the bottom of Westley Road in Acocks Green village]. I had to wait over an hour before I finally got in. There were two films &mdash; <I>I Shot Jesse James</I> (A) was not too bad, but the main film was <I>Dick Barton Strikes Back</I>. This was a super film. Part of the filming was done in Blackpool. The Tower figures prominently.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The first week of April has brought quite varied weather. It has been mostly showery but strong winds have been blowing for the past two days.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I tidied up my tallboy drawers, amongst other things, and listened to &ldquo;Variety Bandbox&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The gales which have been sweeping the coasts are dying down now in some parts. It is windy enough in Acocks Green though.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We all took advantage of the [Bank] holiday by getting up late again today. It rained most of the morning so I brought the trolley indoors and repaired the trolley, which seems to have fallen into an amazing state of decadence.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I cycled to Grandad&rsquo;s and went to the match. B&rsquo;ham were playing Man. Utd. Blues&rsquo; side was:&mdash; Merrick; Duckhouse, Jennings; Boyd, Atkins, Ferris; Berry, Brennan, Trigg, Evans, Warhurst. The result was a goal-less draw. The high wind spoilt a good game.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea we went to the Warwick &amp; saw Abbott &amp; Costello in <I>Pardon My Sarong</I> and <I>Always Another Dawn</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got up first this morning and made the fire. After breakfast I took Ginger for a walk down the village. Later I cycled into Widney Manor.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The birds are very busy at this time of the year; in the rookeries the Rooks are repairing their nests. I saw a lot of birds, Blue Tits, a Great Tit, Bullfinches, Chaffinches, Magpies and a Yellow Hammer. I found five nests. A very neat little nest in a bush was a Chaffinch&rsquo;s I think, but it was deserted. In a tall tree I saw a Magpie&rsquo;s nest with a &ldquo;roof&rdquo; on top. The other three were in tall trees, probably Crows&rsquo; nests.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I helped Dad in the garden after dinner.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I cycled to John Winrow&rsquo;s house [16 Bourne Close] in Kings Heath. It took me well over half an hour to find it from my guide book&rsquo;s directions but it can be reached in 12 minutes (on a bicycle, of course).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been another unsettled day, showery and generally dull.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam and Dad have gone to the pictures this evening as usual [to see Judy Garland in <I>Easter Parade</I> (U) at the Warwick]. I have listened to the last of the present series of &ldquo;Dick Barton&rdquo; and &ldquo;Up the Pole&rdquo;. I am going to bed soon. It is 8.30pm now.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Bob &amp; his girl friend took me to the Speedway at Perry Barr where the &ldquo;Brummies&rdquo; were playing Harringay &ldquo;Racers&rdquo;. It was very thrilling I thought. There were 20 heats; the best was the last one in which Duggan &amp; Waterman were 1st &amp; 2nd while Warren was 3rd. Result B&rsquo;ham 65, Harringay 55.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast Bob and I went for a ride to somewhere in Solihull. We went into a wood and then went in some fields where Bob found a nest which someone had put on the ground. It is an old one made of rootlets, hair &amp; grass, somewhat like that if a Blackcap.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I blew up my football [using a bicycle pump] and Bob and I had a game in the park. After tea I cut more of the lawn.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;As we put the clocks forward last night it was not dark until 8.30pm. I managed to finish the lawn just before nine o&rsquo;clock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had dinner on the bank of the Avon. Nearby there was a Mute Swan sitting on its nest. Later we went through Ann Hathaway&rsquo;s Cottage &amp; saw Shakespeare&rsquo;s birthplace before leaving at 3.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We saw Mary Arden&rsquo;s House at Wilmcote &amp; came back via Wootten Wawen, Oldberrow and Tanworth-in-Arden. I got home at 6.10 having ridden 50 miles; the first journey at 14 m.p.h., the return journey at 9&frac12; m.p.h.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Winny and I went to Bittell today mainly [to] watch birds. It was after midday when we arrived. There is one large reservoir and several smaller lakes. At the one lake there was a Mute Swan on its nest and we had to keep at a distance as the other swan followed us around, especially if we were anyway in the vicinity of the nest.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We saw also Swifts and Swallows, arrived in England about ten days ago. A rather unusual bird was a rabbit, but we saw a Reed Warbler, a Great Crested Grebe (from a distance) which was a [space left] I think. We walked a good twelve miles &amp; lost count of the time: it was after 7.15 when I got home.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam and Dad have gone to the cinema to see <I>East of Java</I> (A) and <I>Calamity Jane &amp; Sam Bass</I> (U) at the Warwick]. I have been reading my <I>B.O.P.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened this morning but this afternoon I went to see Blues&rsquo; last home match v Aston Villa. Villa scored first after 43 mins. through Ford, rather against the run of play. Trigg equalised &amp; then put Blues in the lead, but ten minutes from time Ford got Villa&rsquo;s equaliser.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was Fred Harris&rsquo;s last match at St. Andrews &amp; Blues&rsquo; last Div. I match for at least 16 months.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At Wembley Arsenal beat Liverpool in the Cup Final, Lewis scoring both goals. Arsenal:&mdash; Swindin; Scott, Barnes; Forbes, L.Compton, Mercer (Capt.); Cox, Logie, Goring, Lewis, D.Compton.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has rained nearly all day.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The <I>Mail</I> today published my letter &ldquo;Robbing the Nests&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been out all day helping Dad. We have converted the cycle shed into a coal shed, having &ldquo;highered&rdquo; the roof &amp; put down a platform on which to put the coal. The new cycle shed will be over the drain. This is all being done so that we can convert what is now the coalhouse into a pantry or perhaps a cloakroom. Certainly indoor coalhouses are most unsatisfactory and most un-hygienic.</P>

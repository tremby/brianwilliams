<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Biology we are doing Respiration. Today, in J.T.C. I had to continue my instruction of the &ldquo;Lying Load&rdquo; and holding and aiming. I was to have taken shooting today but it was cancelled for some reason or another.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town and called at the G.P.O. This afternoon I did prep. Mrs. Paige came.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been getting my diary completely up to date this evening and listening to the radio too.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I listened to a Coventry Hippodrome Variety in celebration of its Birthday Week then the first of a third series of &ldquo;Ray&rsquo;s A Laugh&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;Dear Sir&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life with the Lyons&rdquo;. It is nearly 10.0pm now.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning brought heavy rain and I had to go to school on the Special Bus. I had intended to cycle. weather</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Biology we measured our pulse and breathing rates before and after exercise. My pulse increased only slightly from 77&ndash;86 per minute. My breathing went from 13&ndash;17 per minute after climbing on to a stool ten times.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school Dr. Willis Grant wanted to see me. I didn&rsquo;t go to an Alto practice on Wednesday.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Kipper and I walked to Priory Road since there was a long queue for the tram. I got home shortly before 1.30pm and did prep during the afternoon. I also watched the composite Newsreel.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad and I cycled to Blues&rsquo; home match v Barnsley. There was a special cheer for Merrick when the teams came out. He gave a brilliant display against Sheffield Utd. last week and saved a penalty, and again on Wednesday he saved a penalty when keeping goal for the English League v Scottish League. It is very likely that he will get his first cap v Wales on Nov 14th. Blues were behind within two minutes. Atkins passed back but Smith nipped in &amp; passed to McCormack who scored easily. Then only Hough in the Barnsley goal prevented a rout. Stewart scored after 17 mins., and Briggs after 52 mins. Score 2&ndash;1.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today has perhaps been November 5th but it can hardly have been Guy Fawkes&rsquo; Day. It has rained all day long and washed out all this evening&rsquo;s activities. I had arranged to play a match at Selly Oak too but this too had to be put off. I spent the morning getting my Biology note-book up to date. weather</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner, Mam and I watched a Laurel and Hardy film <I>Pack Up Your Troubles</I>. I think it must have been at least twenty years old but it was quite enjoyable. [In fact it was made in 1931 by Hal Roach, who continued to direct Laurel &amp; Hardy until 1940. In the next five years they made eight films for 20th Century-Fox. Their last film together was <I>Robinson Crusoeland</I> (1950). I shall actually see Laurel &amp; Hardy when they come to the Hippodrome next year.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ginger had to come into the house this evening. She was very scared of the fireworks which have been going off since about 5.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I listened to &ldquo;P.C. 49&rdquo; this evening and to the first episode of &ldquo;Danger Money&rdquo;, a new Edward J. Mason thriller. Later, after taking Ginger out I heard &ldquo;Oliver Again&rdquo; and &ldquo;Argument&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was rather unfortunate in that I was too late to obtain a seat so, instead, I decided to join a five thousand crowd outside the Odeon cinema to watch the film stars arriving for the Replica Royal Film Performance. The film was <I>Where No Vultures Fly</I> directed by Sir Michael Balcon who was present this evening. Leslie Mitchell interviewed the stars as they arrived.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our 1st XV played Dunt&rsquo;s at Eastern Road this afternoon. The pitch was waterlogged in places. We lost the match by three tries and a goal (14 pts) to one try and a goal (8 pts). Generally speaking we played quite well, better than we have done all the season. I had my best game this season. We were rather unfortunate to be eleven points down at half time. Dunt&rsquo;s got one more try but tired towards the end and we scored two tries, one of them converted, in a minute. I had a hand in both. The match was played with six balls. Five of them went over the fence. rugby</P>

I must say I was rather sceptical when I saw the title in the <I>Radio Times</I>. As it turned out, Offen&rsquo;s bach was much worse than his bite and it was a most enjoyable performance, Terry-Thomas adding a touch of modernity with his introduction. He also intervened with a version of &ldquo;Twenty Questions&rdquo; and read a Spartan News Bulletin in the best American Style.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In English we finished reading <I>The Doctor&rsquo;s Dilemma</I>. During last period this morning, Mr. Leeds gave us the first part of our French examination. It was a piece of French into English and then there were seven questions to be answered on a second piece of French.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had our Biology exam all afternoon but I only got about 20%. I could have written pages on Histology of Tissues, Digestion, the Skeleton and Respiration but these topics were not included or sometimes only a special part of them.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the Special Bus. In Children&rsquo;s Hour T.V. I watched a film &ldquo;Mystery of the Hooded Horsemen&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I then did all my homework and tonight we have watched &ldquo;World Survey&rdquo;, a short play &ldquo;The Angel who Pawned Her Harp&rdquo; and &ldquo;What&rsquo;s My Line?&rdquo;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning the Head told us that it has been decided to give the eight houses [permanent] names. Most of them will be the names of famous Headmasters of K.E.S. Mr. Copland&rsquo;s House will become Vardy House from next term.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In French we had the second part of our exam. Our Chemistry started at the beginning of school and lasted until 12.55. I got about 30% but could have got at least 50% if I&rsquo;d had more time.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I did all my homework and went to Cubs this evening. We have about a dozen cubs now but the Scouts have touched rock-bottom again, only two or three regulars.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got home I found that David and Marjorie had come. Grace has become engaged to Arthur [Williams &mdash; no relation: they will be married on 6th June 1953].</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I cycled to school this morning and met Mr. Monkcom. As I expected I got just 20% in the Biology exam. It is most remarkable that I can&rsquo;t get good marks in exams!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had a B.B.C. audition this afternoon and since I had to be there early I had the afternoon off, the Physics exam too!</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a poem to read on December 15th in &ldquo;Midland Magazine&rdquo; and also a chief part in a play in which I am a sort of schoolboy &ldquo;Sherlock Holmes&rdquo;. It should be fun.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I had been looking forward to seeing &ldquo;How Do You View?&rdquo; this evening but Terry-Thomas has been taken ill with Pleurisy and the show could not take place. The other members did put on a show though with the aid of Jimmy Edwards, and we were taken behind the scenes to see how the T.V. cameras work. [Mr. Monkcom told me that he and Jimmy Edwards had been in the same form at school but Jimmy was much funnier then than now!]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We did drill all through the morning in J.T.C.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I played for the 1st XV v Kay&rsquo;s this afternoon. We lost our sixth match in succession by 28 pts to 14. It was hardly a true representation of the game. We had easily as much of the play as Kay&rsquo;s. In fact, our opponents hardly left their half of the field in the second half but when they did break away they inevitably scored tries. Our 14 pts came during a long period of sustained pressure. We got a goal and three penalties. rugby</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home through town as I had to call at Jas. Woodhouse&rsquo;s in New Street. Mam bought a table three weeks ago and it has yet to be delivered.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got home I had a bath. I listened to the radio tonight and took Ginger for a walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I went down the village and paid &pound;1 5s 0d into my Bank account.] I didn&rsquo;t go to school until this afternoon, when I cycled.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to town with Mam and called at Woodhouse&rsquo;s. The table, we were told, would arrive today and it did, at 12.30pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We came home on the 44 &rsquo;bus as I had an appointment with Mr. Parker, the dentist. After examining my teeth, he said he would extract three and re-fill two teeth. The extractions will be next Tuesday at 9.30. What a horrible thought. However, the sooner my teeth are attended to, the better.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was late for school this afternoon and so missed Gym. We continued analysis in Chemistry.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I watched the Newsreel &amp; &ldquo;I Made News&rdquo; this evening then switched off. As it happened, the Sutton Coldfield transmitter broke down for 90 mins at 9.5.</P>

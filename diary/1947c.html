<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The weather was not very pleasant &mdash; cold and windy &mdash; but the park was crowded with people.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;<I>Blighty</I> comes out every Wednesday and today&rsquo;s issue (dated the 19th which is Saturday) is No. 403. I have worked out that if it has been printed every week the first issue must have been dated 28th October 1939, which is nearly 8 weeks after the War started.</P>

<h3>FRIDAY 1st AUGUST 1947

   <td width=550 valign="top">

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We are all very excited as we have been getting our things packed ready to go on holiday to Lowestoft. I wrote a composition about last year&rsquo;s holiday: the following is copied from my exercise book and is part of my 1946 Diary:&mdash;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Lowestoft, a very well known holiday resort, stands about ten miles south of Great Yarmouth. Before the war it had a very fine pier but now it&rsquo;s in two parts [deliberately destroyed to prevent German troops from landing]. At Lowestoft, one of the most interesting things is the harbour. Early in the morning the trawlers come in with lots of fish. There&rsquo;s a swing bridge over the river because many of the ships&rsquo; masts are too big. Then the bridge swings automatically round for the ship to go through.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On the north side of the harbour the sea never goes out, and now, instead of a beach, there is a big concrete promenade. The southern part of Lowestoft is called Pakefield. Here on the top of a cliff is an old ruined church with a grave yard about 130 years old. Quite often bones of the people are found. (I found one myself). You can see the stones at the bottom of the cliff. Then there is the Kensington Gardens. It has a lake with little boats called &ldquo;Scootaboats&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;If you were to follow the river from the harbour you would come to the curing yards. Here, strange[ly] enough, are mostly Scottish girls. Past the curing yards are the dry docks. Here I saw the trawler &ldquo;Peaceful Star&rdquo; which went out with the B.B.C. men to the Dogger Bank broadcasting over the radio.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;About half a mile from the harbour are the Oulton Broads which join the Norfolk Broads. Here you see an amazing number of yachts and pleasure boats with plenty of wind to drive you along as the country is very low-lying and level.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Lowestoft is a very interesting place.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went to town and bought a copy of the Ian Allan <I>ABC of GWR Locomotives</I>, 1/6d. This is the 6th edition, checked up to June 1st. There are quite a lot of changes since I got the 3rd Edition in 1944. There are now &ldquo;County&rdquo; Class locomotives. These are numbered 1000 <I>County of Middlesex</I> (which I have already seen several times) to 1029 <I>County of Worcester</I>. There are also new &ldquo;Castles&rdquo;, 5098&ndash;5099 and 7000&ndash;7007.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The G.W.R. has also been renumbering quite a lot of locomotives, including the eleven remaining &ldquo;Dukes&rdquo;. 3254 <I>Cornubia</I> is now 9054, and so on. It is a shame that they have lost their original numbers, but it is because there are some new 2251 Class 0&ndash;6&ndash;0 locomotives which need to be numbered 3200&ndash;3209.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The worst renumbering is of &ldquo;Hall&rdquo; Class locomotives which have been fitted for oil-burning instead of coal. There are 11 of these and their numbers have been changed from being 4900s or 5900s to 3900s, all out of order. For instance, 3900&ndash;3904 used to be 4968, 4971, 4948, 4907 and 4972 respectively. Then 3950&ndash;3955 were formerly 5955, 5976, 6957, 6953, 5986 and 6949.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Space has been left for us to write in the names and former numbers of other &ldquo;Halls&rdquo; as they are converted, but the whole system is a mess. I see (from the symbol &para; against their names) that 100 A1 <I>Lloyds</I> and 4081 <I>Warwick Castle</I> are now oil-burners, as are also 5039 <I>Rhuddlan Castle</I>, 5079 <I>Lysander</I>, 5083 <I>Bath Abbey</I>, and 5091 <I>Cleeve Abbey</I> but they have not been renumbered.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Another difference from my 1944 <I>ABC</I> is that Hall-class locos 6916&ndash;6959 have now been given names. The last of these, 6959 <I>Peatling Hall</I> and 11 new Halls, 6960&ndash;6970, are modified Halls with re-designed boilers.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I went to St. Andrews to see Blues&rsquo; first match of the season against Barnsley. It was a shocking result as they lost 3&ndash;2, and no one has ever seen seen any team score 3 goals against Blues in any home match since the War. Unfortunately there was a late change to the side as Southam played instead of Dennis Jennings.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Birmingham City:&mdash; Merrick; Trigg, Southam; Harris, Duckhouse, Mitchell; Goodwin, McIntosh, Dougall, Bodle, Edwards. Bodle and Mitchell (penalty) scored Blues&rsquo; goals.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Blues have been playing cricket during the summer. Gil Merrick is a fast bowler like Tom Pritchard.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Birmingham City:&mdash; Merrick; Trigg, Quinton; Harris, McDonnell, Mitchell; Hughes, Dougall, Aveyard, Bodle, Edwards.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Matt McDonnell was playing his first game for Blues, and Hughes is a new right-winger.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Syd Owen was playing left-half for Luton, and Billy Hughes left-back. Syd Owen used to play for Blues and I have got his autograph. Billy Hughes was playing for Blues last season but was transferred in July. Why do Blues keep transferring their best players?</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a great shock that Blues have now transferred Wilson Jones to Nottingham Forest. He has been playing centre forward for Birmingham since 1934 and is one of my favourite players. I have his picture on a cigarette card.</P>

[In six years&rsquo; time, I shall play just once in the same side as he. He will go on to play for Coventry, England and the British Lions. I shall not play rugger again due to a knee injury.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Australia won by a single try scored by McLean early on, so it was a disappointing game.</P>

It is a bit odd [but almost 55 years later I meet Neil Gardner and ask him about this. Neil writes:&mdash; &ldquo;The reason that I finished behind you in class was because Coco failed to call out my name. He, of course, denied this and I think I became &lsquo;Tick&rsquo; Gardner for a while, losing the title later to West&rdquo;].</P>

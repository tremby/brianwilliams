<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the 35th Annual Boy Scouts Rally at Handsworth Park today. I caught the 44 &rsquo;bus as usual to Baker Street, then went with the cubs on the charabanc to Handsworth. The Salute was taken by General Sir William J. Slim, G.B.E., K.C.B., D.S.O., M.C., who is an Old Edwardian. The Band of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment played.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We went to the Mission as usual after dinner.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been looking at the beautiful letter-card I got yesterday on the way back from the Rally. I got off the 44 in the village and happened to see a &ldquo;Souvenir Letter Card of Acocks Green &mdash; Six Views in Photo-Colour&rdquo; at Wells&rsquo; Newsagents (Warwick Road). I had to buy it as the pictures were all taken before the War and are in colour too. They are also available as postcards and I am going to treasure them. They show:&mdash;</P>

<P>(1) Shirley Road and Olton Boulevard &mdash; the big island just round the corner from where we live.</P>

<P>(2) Westley Road and Square, showing the island in the village but before it was developed.</P>

<P>(3) Sherbourne Road, Five Ways &mdash; the junction of Dudley Park Road, Station Road, Oxford Road, Yardley Road and Sherbourne Road (not the Five Ways at the end of Broad Street in town).</P>

<P>(4) Warwick Road &mdash; looking down to the village from Flint Green Road; there is a school crossing sign on the left with a black and white pole surmounted by a red triangle, and a &ldquo;torch&rdquo; sign with the word &ldquo;School&rdquo;.</P>

<P>(5) The Village Square &mdash; viewed from the bottom of Westley Road: it must have been taken from upstairs at the Warwick Cinema, and shows the No. 11 Outer Circle &rsquo;bus stop on the left (where we get off the Special Bus) and the New Inn on the right.</P>

<P>(6) Warwick Road &mdash; looking down towards Station Road and the village. It is taken from outside Bata, with Halford&rsquo;s next door, and across the road Sam Leston&rsquo;s, then William Daw&rsquo;s the fish shop. [In 12 years&rsquo; time their son Michael Daw will marry Freda&rsquo;s sister Rosemary and so become my brother-in-law.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not know why the captions refer to the village &ldquo;square&rdquo;. It is not square at all, nor ever could have been, and I have never heard anybody call it that.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went straight from school to the County Ground today to see the final day of Eric Hollies&rsquo; benefit match against Kent. It ended in a draw.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Warwickshire scored 478 on Saturday. Fred Gardner scored 126, Tom Dollery 93, and Martin Donnelly 61. Gardner and Donnelly made a 3rd wicket stand of 113.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Todd and Fagg opened for Kent, but after Todd was out for 49 the batting collapsed. Fagg was finally bowled by Hollies for 99 and Kent were all out for 198, giving Warwickshire a lead of 280.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I arrived Kent were following on and Todd and Fagg were batting. Fagg got his century, then was caught and bowled by Hollies for 106. L.E.G. Ames came in and scored 46 before being caught at the wicket by Spooner off Maudsley, at which point the match ended with Kent having scored 287 for 2 and Todd 127 not out. It was a frustrating end to the match.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to Cubs tonight.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This new pen [with which I have written the previous line] is called a &ldquo;Fisherbond Pen Pencil&rdquo;. Some of the boys at school are now using &ldquo;Biro&rdquo;s which do not have a nib but write with a tiny ball-point at the end of a thin tube containing the ink. As I was keen to have one, Dad got me this one from Lewis&rsquo;s.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is silver-coloured and 4&frac12; inches long, including the piece at the end which measures half an inch and screws off to allow for the ink-tube to be inserted. There is also a clip to fasten it in one&rsquo;s pocket. The pen has a bore of about a quarter of an inch, but the writing end is tapered so as to hold the ink-tube securely. [I still have this &ldquo;ballpoint pen&rdquo; 52 years &mdash; and many refills &mdash; later!]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have had my tin of coins a long time. The pennies, halfpennies and farthings we use every day are mainly King George VI now, but there are almost as many of King George V (1910&ndash;1935). There are also lots of pennies and halfpennies of King Edward VII (1901&ndash;1910) and Queen Victoria (1837&ndash;1901).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My favourite is a 1797 penny of George III which is 1 3/8 ins. across and weighs nearly an ounce. I have cleaned it with Chemico and it has come up quite well. I also have a George III halfpenny dated 1775 which is my oldest coin, and a George III farthing dated 1806 or 1807.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I also have a medal 2 inches in diameter and weighing over 2 ounces, of King George V and Queen Mary, and on the other side a sailing boat, crown and trumpeters. The sail is the Royal Ensign. On the side of the boat is the name &ldquo;A Toft&rdquo;, and underneath, the date 1911. To the right of the King&rsquo;s head I can see through my magnifying glass a monogram with A and T superimposed and below it M.B.L<SMALL>D</SMALL>. [The D is in small capitals]. I think it must have been made to celebrate the Coronation on June 22nd 1911.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The other coins are:</P>

<P>&bull; Australia, One Shilling, George V, 1918, it has a kangaroo and emu supporting a shield with a star above it, and the motto &ldquo;Advance Australia&rdquo;</P>

<P>&bull; Switzerland (Confoederatio Helvetica), 10 &mdash; (not stated), 1906</P>

<P>&bull; ? Turkey, date in Arabic which I can&rsquo;t read</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are also three coins which I cannot identify:&mdash;</P>

<P>&bull;&nbsp;A silver coin, the size of a sixpence, with a leaf and flower pattern round the edge. It feels Arabic and has a design resembling the shape of India, with the date 177V, except that the 7s face the opposite way, and H underneath.</P>

<P>&bull;&nbsp;Another silver coin, with squiggles, and the head of a young king facing left and wearing a fez. Could it be the young King Farouk of Egypt?</P>

<P>&bull;&nbsp;A worn copper disc, the size of a penny, perhaps not a coin at all, but there is evidence of what might be oriental design.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Excluding British coins, I have some 45 coins from about 25 countries. They have been handled by millions of people and now I am handling them. What history they tell! The tin they are kept in is also interesting. It measures a little under 3&frac14; x 2&frac14; x &frac34;, made by Glaxo Laboratories Ltd., Greenford, Middlesex. It has the number SG226 in the corner, and originally contained 100 Cod Liver Oil capsules.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been volunteered to be in charge of the Cot-Fund and have to collect money from all the boys in the form. I collected 4/9d in Scripture last period this afternoon. At Hartfield Crescent I used to collect the Milk Money for Mrs. Wright. [One Monday morning I counted the money, pennies and halfpennies and the odd threepenny bit &mdash; about 200 coins &mdash; and arranged them in shilling piles, 12 pennies to each, then pennies and halfpennies, then stacks of 24 halfpennies, until I had 11 piles of shillings and 11 halfpennies (11s 5&frac12;d). Dividing this by 2&frac12;d I discovered that only 55 boys had paid but there were 56 children in the class. Mrs. Wright asked who had not paid, but no one owned up. There was some further delay while I checked the money again, then, very red-faced, I had to admit that the missing 2&frac12;d was still in my pocket.] [C2 maths set list]</P>

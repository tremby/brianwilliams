<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I played out for some time and took Ginger for a short walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I cut part of the back lawn &amp; all the front lawn.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I made a poster for Scouts.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 8.30 I t0ok Ginger for her evening walk. It was a lovely evening. I went through the village as usual. What struck me was the large number of people looking into the shop windows. Actually this is Acocks Green Shopping Week and amongst other competitions there is a deliberate mistake competition in which one must identify 50 mistakes in local shops in order to win the &pound;50 prize.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing much happened at school. There was a Choir practice as usual. We had Mr. P. Cadenhead for our Gym period.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After school I went to a meeting of the Natural History Society. Two interesting films, &ldquo;Wood Ants&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bird Sanctuary&rdquo; were shown.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got home just in time to hear the first instalment of a new series of &ldquo;Dick Barton&rdquo;. Having done my prep. I went to the Library to get a book on the climate Holland, but returned with a History book of Birmingham.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning the whole school was shocked to hear of the death in a road accident yesterday of Robert P. Moseley (Hist. Div.). Pickworth is also in hospital seriously ill.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This tragedy marred Field Marshal Montgomery of Alamein&rsquo;s visit this afternoon. He inspected the C.C.F. on the South Field before we marched past. After this &ldquo;Monty&rdquo; spoke to us in Big School &amp; amongst other things he told us about his visit to Moscow in January 1947 and all about Marshall Stalin. There was a photo of the inspection in tonight&rsquo;s <I>[Birmingham] Mail</I> and <I>[Evening] Despatch</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Chemistry we completed last week&rsquo;s experiment.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I played inside-right for Robin Hood Jets in a home practice match at Shirley Park. For the first half we kicked against the wind and were 6&ndash;1 down at the interval. The final result was 9&ndash;5. I got our third goal. As we were three men short, Mr. Cook played for us &amp; we also borrowed two players. Nevertheless the other team was bigger &amp; faster.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I fetched my <I>Meccano Magazine</I> &amp; the <I>Sports Argus</I>. Later I took Ginger out for walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home via Selly Oak and on the [No.11] Outer Circle bus for a change. When I got home I did prep. until nearly 6.0pm. (I had some dinner of course).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At dinner time I played football.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Mam took Clarice and Julia to the Ideal Home Exhibition. I spent over a couple of hours writing up Biology notes. Mr. Moore came at about 8.0pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today being Founder&rsquo;s Day we did not have to go to school. Instead twenty of us or more played a match at Selly Oak Park at 10.0am. My side was:&mdash; Barnard; C.J. Roberts, Jarmain; Bailey, Martin (Capt.), Pressdee; Myself, Barker, Ayto, Picken and L.M. James. During the first half I played in no less than five different positions! I was back in my proper position for the second half though. We lost 7&ndash;6 but it was not a bad game.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent all the afternoon doing homework but in the evening I wrote some more of my book <I>Smugglers&rsquo; Bay</I>. Four chapters are almost complete &mdash; I have got the plot all worked out nicely now.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I bought today&rsquo;s <I>Rover</I> (2d) as usual, No 1320, with pictures of motor-bikes on the cover, and an interesting strip, &ldquo;Flights That Brought Fame&rdquo; (the Wright Brothers, Bleriot, Alcock &amp; Brown etc). I am reading a football story &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Teamwork that Counts&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Phantom Flyer&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Tough of the Track&rdquo;. There are also adverts for Wren&rsquo;s Dubbin which I always use on my football boots, Hornby Trains and Spangles, and instructions for making a telephone using two tins and a long piece of string &mdash; I am going to make one for Clarice and Julia to play with.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Physics we had a short test. Last period &mdash; French &mdash; we had &ldquo;Vingt Questions&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 4.0pm I had to be at the B.B.C. studios in Broad Street for another audition for &ldquo;Midland Magazine&rdquo;. All being well I shall be making my third broadcast a month tomorrow. I am reading a short story.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I got home for seven o&rsquo;clock and during the evening I did prep. When it started to rain I went outside to stoke up the bonfire and it is now burning merrily.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I came home on the Special as usual and started on my homework straight away.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Later in the evening I went to the Library and brough back a Gazetteer of the World. Unfortunately the latest population figures were for 1901. The population [of] Birmingham for instance is given as 533, 040, only half of its present population &mdash; about 1, 260, 000.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There has been a lot of talk lately about &ldquo;Flying Saucers&rdquo;.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On January 7th 1948 at Fort Knox a 500 ft saucer appeared shooting out blasts of red flame. Capt. Mantell went up in a plane after it. The &ldquo;saucer&rdquo; dodged about to avoid the plane, the wreckage of which was found over a wide area.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We had a Geography test this morning on the natural vegetation of the world. Nothing else happened all day. I came home on the Special as usual.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have just spent the greater part of the evening doing homework but I also went down to the Library and brought back four books, three on North Cornwall an Devon, and a fourth on the birds of Malvern.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 8.45 we listened to the first episode of &ldquo;Paul Temple and the Van Dyke Affair&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;All our Divinity period this morning was spent in taking notes. In our English periods we started reading Shakespeare&rsquo;s <I>The Taming of the Shrew</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing else happened and as I was not picked for Copland&rsquo;s 2nd XV v Biggs&rsquo; I came straight home. I did all my homework in the afternoon and went to Cubs tonight.</P>

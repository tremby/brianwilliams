<h3>THURSDAY 1st JANUARY 1948

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My new &ldquo;Cromwell Series&rdquo; Diary is the same as last year&rsquo;s but with a dark blue shiny cover. It is &ldquo;British Made&rdquo; and has a picture of Oliver Cromwell for the Registered Trade Mark. It measures 4 <SUP>1</SUP>/<SUB>8</SUB> &times; 2&frac34; inches, with two weeks to an opening, and has coloured maps of Europe and The World for the front and back end-papers.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 15 pages of useful notes including Bank Holidays, Law Sittings and Law Vacations, Quarter Days and Half-Quarter Days.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are also Postal Rates &mdash; Inland and Imperial and Foreign.</P>

<P>These are the same as last year:&mdash; 2&frac12;d to post an ordinary letter up to 2&nbsp;ounces, 2d for a postcard and 1d for printed papers. A letter to anywhere in the British Empire, up to one ounce, is also 2&frac12;d. Letters to the rest of the world cost 3d. Poundage on Postal Orders to the value of 6d or 1/- is 1d; 1/6 to 5/-, 1&frac12;d; 6/- to 21/-, 2d. It costs 1/- for Telegrams of up to 9 words, each additional word costs an extra 1d.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 3 pages of Weights and Measures giving their Metric and Imperial Equivalents, also Measures of Capacity and Weight including Avoirdupois (which sounds French), Troy (which sounds Greek), and Apothecaries (which sounds like the chemist&rsquo;s).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There is a whole page giving the addresses and telephone numbers of London Theatres, followed by a 2-page map of central London showing the location of 36 Theatres and the various Underground stations. This will be very useful if I ever go to London.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Also in the Diary are calendars for 1947 and 1949, Hints for Health and Comfort, and Simple First Aid Hints, followed by Seasonal Work in the Garden &mdash; what to do each month. These are by E.C. Cooper, F.R.H.S. (late Kew Gardens).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;On the Personal Mems page I have inscribed my name and address:&mdash; BDWilliams, 153, Circular Rd., Acocks Green, Birmingham, and filled in some of the other details. It doesn&rsquo;t ask for my Date of Birth, but this is July 31st 1935, so I am 12 years, 5 months and 1 day old.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t fill in the Telephone No. because we are not on the telephone, or my Armed Forces Reg. No. because I have not been called up yet. I haven&rsquo;t got a Bank Book No. as I do not have a Bank Account, nor do Mam and Dad.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;May National Reg. No. is QBJM 123/3. I don&rsquo;t know what the letters signify, but Dad is QBJM 123/1 and Mam is QBJM 123/2, so I suppose Clarice and Julia are QBJM 123/4 and 5 respectively. My Ration Book Number is JE 150040. (We have to go up town to get our Ration Books from the Food Office in Broad Street.) My Bicycle or Motor No. is H397052, my Insurance Policy Number is 10S504742104, and Savings Certificate Number is EK18874. (This is for 15/- and I got it in exchange for 30 savings stamps stuck in a National Savings Book.)</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t got a Watch No. as I do not have a watch, and I can&rsquo;t fill in my Weight and Date as I haven&rsquo;t been weighed lately. Last year I weighed 5 stones 5 lbs 0ozs.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The last page before the Diary proper begins is for Memoranda. It contains Phases of the Moon etc., &ldquo;Reproduced from the Nautical Almanac by permission of the Controller of H.M. Stationery Office&rdquo; &mdash; it has not moved since last year. I intend to use this space to copy out the list of Meteors which I always want to see. The Draconids are due tomorrow.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have also made the first entry in my Boots Scribbling Diary. The G.W.R., L.M.S., L.N.E.R. and S.R. were nationalised today. The new title is &ldquo;British National Railways&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not see any of the Draconids last night as the sky was cloudy. We are having a lot of rain.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam took us to town this morning and we went to the News Theatre in High Street. We saw 6 Disney cartoons and a film showing the highlights of 1947.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We went to the B.S.A. New Year party today. At St. Andrews Bi&nbsp; &nbsp;Dad and I went to St. Andrews as usual. Blues were playing Plymouth Argyle but could only draw 1&ndash;1, despite winning 3&ndash;nil when they played them away, and 6&ndash;1 at St. Andrews last season. It reminds me that I never saw Blues lose a match until 16th March 1946 when Blues were top of the League and Plymouth were bottom, but they lost 1&ndash;nil.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Birmingham City:&mdash; Wheeler; Green, Jennings; Harris, Duckhouse, Mitchell; Goodwin, McIntosh, Dougall, Bodle, Laing. Jack Goodwin scored. The attendance was 36,000.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We all went to the B.S.A. New Year party tonight.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The <I>Birmingham Mail</I> has gone up to 1&frac12;d today, so it is going to cost us 9d a week instead of 6d.</P>

We shall have to wait a fortnight for further instalments of &ldquo;The Eyes of the Blind Outlaw&rdquo;, &ldquo;Khyber Lightning&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cannonball Kidd&rdquo; (my favourite) and &ldquo;Mr. Barrel&rsquo;s Little Sister&rdquo; in the 600th issue.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to St Andrews this afternoon to see Birmingham City&rsquo;s 3rd round F.A. Cup tie against Notts County. They lost 2&ndash;nil. I cannot believe they have lost, and at home too, to a Third Division team, after getting to the semi-final in 1945&ndash;46 and the 6th round last season. It is a terrible shock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Birmingham City:&mdash; Wheeler; Green, Jennings; Badham, Duckhouse, Harris; Goodwin, Dougall, Trigg, Mitchell, Edwards. The great England centre-forward Tommy Lawton was playing for Notts County. There were 53,000 people at the match, about the biggest crowd of the season.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening I went to Kipper (Chris Martin)&rsquo;s party at 8 Oxford Road.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;John is 36 days older, and Kipper 16 days younger, than me. The three of us are in our second term at King Edward&rsquo;s High School.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went straight from school today to see Blues play at Villa Park. Aston Villa won 2&ndash;1. Blues led 1&ndash;nil at half-time with a goal by Cyril Trigg, but Dorsett and Ford scored for Villa in the last 10 minutes. It was a big crowd &mdash; about 40,000.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Aston Villa:&mdash; Jones (K.); Potts, Cummings; Dorsett, Moss (F.), Lowe (E.); Edwards, Brown, Ford, Parkes, Smith (L.).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Birmingham City:&mdash; Merrick; Green, Jennings; Harris, Duckhouse, Mitchell; Stewart, Dougall, Trigg, Bodle, Edwards.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;If Blues win promotion this year they will meet Villa in the First Division next season. Birmingham City are 5 points clear of Newcastle United and have a game in hand so should get promoted. They have the best defensive record &mdash; only 17 goals scored against them (8 fewer than the next best team, Tottenham Hotspur) &mdash; but only 5 teams (all in the bottom 6) have scored fewer goals! Their record is:&mdash;</P>

<P>P 26, Won 16, Lost 4, Drawn 6, For 34, Agst 17, Pts 38, Posn 1st.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Aston Villa are 9th in the First Division with 27 points from 25 games.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Van Gogh Exhibition has opened at the Art Gallery. I would have gone there if I had not been going to the match.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is Septuagesima today, also the Conversion of St. Paul. This is quite useful to know. But I have had to look it up in Dad&rsquo;s pre-war <I>Daily Express Modern English Illustrated Dictionary</I> to find what it means: &ldquo;The 3rd Sunday before Lent&rdquo;. Next Sunday February 1st is Sexagesima (2nd before Lent), the 8th is Quinquagesima (the Sunday next before Lent), and the 15th is Quadragesima (Lent).</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I love to look at Dad&rsquo;s Dictionary. It has coloured maps of the British Isles, the World showing the British Empire, and Europe (Political), articles on &ldquo;How a great newspaper is produced&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Dictionary and the working man&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Origin and History of Dictionaries&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Origin and Development of the English Language&rdquo;, &ldquo;Principles of English Grammar&rdquo;, &ldquo;A History of English Spelling&rdquo;, &ldquo;Great English Writers&rdquo;, etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are also photographs in colour of the Unknown Warrior&rsquo;s Grave, Rare Birds of Brilliant Plumage, Canada Game Birds, Boats of Various Climes, Flags and Funnel Marks of Steamship Companies, Various Breeds of Horses, Leading Breeds of Dogs, Standard Cattle, Ceramic and Decorative Art, Paris Fashions from 1500, Famous Gems and Precious Stones, Precious Gems as they are found, Orders and Decorations of Honour, Various forms of headdress ancient and modern, Marine Life, the races of man, Circulation of the Blood, Birds, Slippers of various nations &mdash; ancient and modern, Butterflies and moths, Plants of great commercial value, Habitations of mankind, Principal edible grains, and Ribands of some of the best known British and foreign Decorations and Medals.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The black and white photographs are just as interesting:&mdash; St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, Cotton Industry, Modern Dairy, The X-Rays, The R&ouml;ntgen Rays, H.M.S. <I>Royal Sovereign</I> and <I>Victory</I>, Modern Types of Aircraft, Types of Automobiles, the Boy Scout Movement (with an article by Robert Baden-Powell), Ships, Lumbering Industry, British Columbia.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have felt very upset today as Mahatma Gandhi has been assassinated. The story is on the front page of the <I>Birmingham Mail</I> and it made me cry. There is a big photo of him which I am cutting out to stick in my big Boots Scribbling Diary which I had for Christmas.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The paper says that Ghandi was shot dead with four revolver bullets fired from close range by a young Hindu. Women tried to shield him with their arms, and there were sobbing crowds at the scene of the tragedy.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Inside, there is an article about his visit to this country in Autumn 1930 when he came to the Round Table Conference, proposing Dominion Status for India. He talked with King George V and Queen Mary, and actually came to Birmingham where he made a speech at Woodbrooke College, Selly Oak. [He actually stayed at the College: I only learned this when we were there for a few days in September 2002 and were given his room!]</P>

I know some of his songs such as <I>One Day When We Were Young</I>, <I>Roses Of Picardy</I>, <I>You Are My Heart&rsquo;s Delight</I>, <I>Ah Sweet Mystery Of Life</I>, <I>Only A Rose</I>, <I>Lover Come Back To Me</I>, <I>Begin the Beguine</I>. (But what is a &ldquo;beguine&rdquo;?)</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We have a set of <I>Music Hall Memories</I> in the piano stool. Being in the Choir I can read music. I can play any tune on the piano but not properly. Miss Stanley has offered to teach me and I have been to her house (96 Olton Boulevard East) and started to learn both hands. She gave me <I>When Mothers of Salem</I> to play but after going there two or three times she told Mam she couldn&rsquo;t do it any more. [Miss Stanley plays the piano at the Mission we attend on Sunday afternoons, and Mrs. Moore plays if Miss Stanley isn&rsquo;t there.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Singing and music will always be an important part of my life, but I never learn how to play the piano properly. But sometimes in my dreams I can.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is Leap Year Day. Girls are allowed to propose to men. [I learned this at school one day recently and feel it is quite useful to know because I like girls but am very nervous of them as I never know what to do. One summer evening, less than ten years later, I call for the girl I have been seeing and we go for a walk. She takes my hand &mdash; which seems to me to be all right as we have been going out for a year or two &mdash; and leads me down a country lane. We stop underneath a tree and she says to me, &ldquo;Oh Brian, I love you madly, passionately, with all my heart &mdash; will you marry me?&rdquo; And I say, &ldquo;Oh Freda, of course I will&rdquo;.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t a Leap Year though.]</P>

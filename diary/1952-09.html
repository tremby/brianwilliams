<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I read more of my <I>Thunder in Europe</I> book. After breakfast I played some gramophone records, then I watched part of the morning&rsquo;s play in the match between Middlesex and Lancashire. Lancs. were all out just before lunch for 246 in reply to the Middlesex total of 125.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I spent the whole afternoon cutting down the hedge on Prentice&rsquo;s side. Dad and I burnt the privet after tea. This evening Don and Ron came again and corrected the sound fault [on the TV set]. Also they tuned 208 rather more accurately. I&rsquo;m listening to 208 now &mdash; Cadbury&rsquo;s &ldquo;Roundabout&rdquo; with Nigel Patrick &mdash; and the reception equals that of the Light Programme.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The man who jumped from a 3rd floor window at Lewis&rsquo;s on Friday died yesterday. He was Frank Ormerod Pilkington (26) of 64 Beeches Drive, Erdington. His is the third suicide and fourth tragic death at Lewis&rsquo;s since April last year.&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went to the Library and took back my John Creasey <I>Thunder in Europe</I> book. I enjoyed reading it very much. It had an exciting climax to a most thrilling story of espionage set in the period just prior to the war. When I got back I spent an hour with my troop register.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[Clarice had a postcard from her friend Pat, on holiday at Ilfracombe, this morning. It is of Mars Hill, Lynmouth, from an original water colour painting by Brian Gerald, and is published by Valentine&rsquo;s, Dundee and London.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today I have done a lot [of] writing up notes &mdash; Chemistry and Physics. I spent some three hours or more writing, then shortly after 2.0pm. I walked to John Winrow&rsquo;s with Ginger. He wasn&rsquo;t in. Perhaps it was fortunate because no sooner was I in the house than there was a terrific clap of thunder and several flashes of lightning. The rain poured down for an hour. Mam, Clarice and Julia were in town at the time, and the storm there wasn&rsquo;t so bad. Later on, the storm cleared somewhat.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent this evening reading and listening to the radio.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went down the village three times in an hour. First of all I got Ginger a sack of straw, then I went to get Mam&rsquo;s meat from the [Co-op] butcher and took Ginger with me, and after that I cycled to the Library and got two books, a Peter Cheyney novel and <I>The Riddle of the Flying Saucers</I> by Gerald Heard.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I read some of this latter book until 3.15 when I watched two television Newsreels. Wednesday&rsquo;s edition was devoted almost entirely to the Farnborough Air Show. Charles Gardner interviewed John Derry who four years ago was the first to fly faster than sound. Flying in a De Havilland 110 he&rsquo;s been producing supersonic bangs by diving from several miles up.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;[I went to the Midland Bank this morning and paid in &pound;1.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The greatest drama in modern aviation was seen by 120,000 people at Farnborough this afternoon. John Derry and his observer were in a DH110 when the plane disintegrated in mid-air. Derry had dived from eight miles up producing a triple bang, then he levelled out and turned across the aerodrome, flying a few feet above the ground. Suddenly the plane blew up. The twin jet engines shot high into the air and then crashed into the packed crowd. Several people are dead, many injured. Now I can look back on what I wrote yesterday and it makes me wonder whether all such ventures must end so inevitable in tragedy. Such is the endless quest for speed.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There is nothing else to record except that we have watched TV this evening.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;We got up at 0.0 today because we were expecting Aunt Doll, Uncle Bill, Dorothy and Cyril from Kidderminster at eleven or thereabout. They arrived just before a rainstorm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner at 1.0. I did some of the washing up while everyone else went for a walk.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our guests had to start back for Kidderminster an hour after tea so as to arrive at a reasonable hour. When I had taken Ginger out this evening, Mam, Dad and I watched a forty minute play &ldquo;Stop the Roundabout&rdquo; by Alwyne Whateley. Michael Bilton was excellent as a little man who marries a big bossy woman. TV seems to be veering towards shorter plays. Whether this is an advantage or not, this evening&rsquo;s effort certainly achieved more in forty minutes than some others have done in almost three times as long.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I went to [the] Library with Ginger and later on we all went to town. We went to the Co-op [in High Street], Smith&rsquo;s [in Corporation Street] and then round part of the museum [in Newhall Street]. We got back in time to see a film <I>Small-Town Boy</I> at 3.15pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam and Dad are at the cinema. They have gone to see <I>Reluctant Heroes</I> at the Warwick. This is the second time the film has been shown at this cinema. It was previously shown on April 3rd for three days. I saw it on the 4th. [Suburban cinemas changed their programme on Thursday, and had a still different programme on Sunday.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mam had to go out this morning so I washed up and after paying the rent collector and [Liverpool Victoria] insurance agent, I went shopping with Ginger. When I got back again, I got some meat for Ginger and then cooked the dinner. [I had been asked to light the gas under the saucepans at the appropriate time.]</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing else happened all day. I spent the afternoon reading and listening to the radio as usual during the evening.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Last Sunday, Aly Naher, the Egyptian Prime Minister, resigned and General Neguib formed a new government. General Neguib, who on July 23rd carried out the coup d&rsquo;etat which resulted in the abdication of King Farouk, thus becomes Prime Minister as well as Commander-in-Chief. After the army had compelled Aly Maher to resign the Premiership, fifty political leaders, including two former Prime Ministers, were arrested.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;John called this morning and we went for a walk &mdash; the same as that which I went last Thursday week.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;It poured with rain for an hour or so this afternoon. I had to go to town to take some letters to the <I>Mail</I> offices [in New Street] for Mam. Having done this, I spent an hour looking at the books in Smith&rsquo;s and the Educational.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to the Olton tonight to see <I>Little Big Shot</I>. Ronald Shiner plays the part of the son of a successful crook. Very tender hearted, he nevertheless determines to follow in his father&rsquo;s footsteps, but in the end his conscience wins. Compared with the two previous Shiner successes, this was rather poor. There were quite a few laughs but all too often, promising situations faded away. I don&rsquo;t think Ronald Shiner&rsquo;s part was strong enough. Derek Farr played his part as a dull-witted det. sgt. well, without being really funny. Marie Lohr was good: she was also in the supporting film, <I>Counterblast</I> (A), a spy story with Robert Beatty, Mervyn Johns and Margaretta Scott.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have not see a Wood Warbler since Wednesday so I should think they have started their migration to Africa by now. The birds we have seen in the garden are stragglers. The normal time for migration is July and August. Our swifts seem to have been gone for almost a month.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This morning I was out with Ginger for three hours. [I went to the Midland Bank to pay another &pound;1 into my account, then] I walked to the Sheldon Cinema via Yardley Road &amp; Coventry Road and home by way of Clay Lane.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to see Blues play Leicester City this afternoon. Blues:&mdash; Merrick; Green, Martin; Boyd, Ferris, Warhurst; Cox, Murphy, Briggs, Rowley, Purdon. Both sides played well and at half-time Leicester led by an Arthur Rowley goal in seven minutes. Hines also hit a post but on the whole play was very even. In the second half, Blues were often brilliant and scored goals thro&rsquo; Rowley, Murphy and Briggs to win 3&ndash;1. They now have 10 points from seven games and are third in the league.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;There is nothing much to record today. I spent most of the morning writing up some old Chemistry notes which I came across the other day.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After dinner I washed up. Mam and Dad went to the Mission. I waited in for Grandad but he did not come to tea.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening Mam, Dad and I watched three short plays by Ben W. Levy. These were <I>The Truth about the Truth</I> with Joan Greenwood, <I>The Island of Cipango</I> with Jean Kent, and <I>The Great Healer</I> with Anne Crawford. They &mdash; the plays, not the actresses &mdash; were not worth seeing. I hope TV will not concentrate on this idea of two or three short plays in one programme. This tendency is evident lately in the film industry. There have been at least two films of Somerset Maugham short stories and <I>Full House</I>, 5 O. Henry stories in another.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today, the last day of my holidays, has been dull and rainy at times.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;John called during the morning and called again this afternoon to see a film on TV with Mam and Dad and me. The film was <I>The Shadow Strikes</I> with Rod la Rocque (whoever that gentleman may or may no longer be) working as a private detective against the underworld. During the afternoon I also went down the village with Ginger.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tea I mowed both lawns. Dad and I watched an Ice Circus from Brighton at 9.20pm.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Willis Grant has promoted me to the noble rank of bass in the choir. I have been singing alto for something approaching three years now. The Choir will not now be included in my B.B.C. Show as Dr. Grant thinks we have got more than enough music to learn anyway.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The S.B. was full so Ian [Blake] and I came home on the 1A &rsquo;bus &mdash; and beat the Special!! At 5.0 I went to Blues&rsquo; home match v Leeds Utd.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today we had three periods of Physics in which I worked with Arthur, Option B and lastly Biology. I went to Mr. Babb in Option B, hoping to start learning German, but since everyone else in the set had done at least a year of the subject, I&rsquo;ve had to give it up before starting. I&rsquo;ll have to do Art instead.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This afternoon I wrote up this morning&rsquo;s Physics experiments and read <I>Picturegoer</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;At 6.30pm a Birmingham Post reporter called to see me about my K.E.S. Variety Show. He stayed for ten minutes.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I took Ginger out at 8.30pm and at 9.0pm we all watched the World Speedway Championship from Wembley. Jack Young retained his title by gaining 14 points from five rides.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today&rsquo;s lessons were double Chemistry, Option A &mdash; for me French &mdash; double Biology, morning school ending at 1.05.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing in particular happened this morning. After dinner, Mam, Dad and I went to the Mission in the Moores&rsquo; car. Mr. Ron Tilsley was the preacher. He spoke and played the piano with his customary vigour.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s My Line?&rdquo; keeps getting swopped around from one evening to another. First we saw it on Mondays, then on a Friday, next on Thursday evenings and now it&rsquo;s been put on Sunday evenings. We watched it tonight. The play was &ldquo;A Month of Sundays&rdquo; by Geo. F. Kerr, and the action takes place in a British officers&rsquo; P.O.W. camp in Southern Germany in 1943. Most of the acting was very good but as is apt to occur with this type of play, the action lagged and the general effect of the play was to some extent lost.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Gym today, the form was split into two groups and we went outdoors to practise some athletics. I am with seven other boys learning to throw the javelin, the rest are throwing the discuss [<I>sic</I>] with Mr. Cadenhead.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;Only twenty-three days ago, when John Derry was killed, I wrote about the quest for speed. This morning, John Cobb, in attempting to break the world water-speed record, was killed when his boat blew up on Loch Ness.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;This evening we listened to &ldquo;Dear Sir ...&rdquo; which has returned to the Light Programme.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;In hymn practice this morning we rehearsed <I>Magnificat</I> and <I>I vow to thee, my country</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got nothing to record for the morning and afternoon.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I went to the Olton tonight to see a comedy <I>Behave Yourself</I> with Farley Granger and Shelley Winters. Farley Granger forgets to buy his wife a wedding anniversary present. A dog called Archie, who has been trained by crooks, follows him home &amp; Shelley Winters thinks it is her present. Farley Granger is content to let her think this. However, when the husband calls at addresses in answer to advertisements for the return of the dog, he discovers a murder. This happens about eight times. The film was very good, fast moving in production and witty in dialogue.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;The other film was <I>The Pace that Thrills</I>, a routine little effort about motor cycle racing. The male lead was Bill Williams.</P>

<H2>Great Granma</H2>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;I love to go to see Granma and Grandad and Fred and the other old grannie who is Daddy&rsquo;s Granma. There is a green cloth with tassles on the table and a green cloth with tassles on the mantelpiece. There is a mirror over the mantelpiece and a mirror on the wall. When I look through one mirror I can see the other one and it goes on for ever.</P>

Thanks, David.  "Causes and Consequences of Revival" was simply
(like all my sermons) a tidied-up transcript from the tape of what
I preached that day in 1976. I have never written sermons out and
then preached from them, except a very few times in the 1950s when
I was required to do so in my training as a local preacher.

I haven't had time to look at the sermon you mention, but I have always
ministered by inspiration, never knowing exactly what I was going to say
but just trusting that the Lord would give me the inspiration.

Hope that doesn't sound too shocking!

Every blessing

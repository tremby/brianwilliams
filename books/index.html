<A HREF="hosea/ch0.html"><H4><FONT SIZE="-3">ENCOUNTER HOSEA</FONT><BR>
Where is Israel? Who are the Jews?<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">The key to prophecy, contained in the Book of Hosea
</FONT></H4></A>
<P>Abraham was not a Jew, Isaac was not a Jew, Jacob was not a Jew, Judah
was not a Jew, Moses was not a Jew. There were no Jews in Egypt. The first
time the word Jew is used in the Bible they are at war with <I>Israel</I>.
The name Jew was only ever used of the remnant of the House of Judah which
returned from exile in Babylon. Jesus was not a Jew in the sense that we now
understand the word.</P>

<P>This little book, a verse-by-verse exposition of the Book of Hosea,
brings out with startling clarity the contrasting destinies of the House of
Israel (ten tribes) and the House of Judah (two tribes). Only a remnant of
the latter became known as Jews.</P>

<P>The approach counteracts two great errors common in Biblical teaching
today&mdash;first that school of thought which insists on spiritualizing all
the promises made to Israel by applying them to the Church, and secondly
that of evangelical fundamentalists who aggressively apply God&rsquo;s
promises to the modern Israeli state in Palestine as &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
chosen people&rdquo; and so dictate American foreign policy.</P>

<P>Hosea holds the key to Bible prophecy and has peculiar pertinence for
today, again a time when church and nation are in moral and spiritual
decay.</P>

<A HREF="BritProph/ch0.html"><H4>Britain in Prophecy</H4></A>

<p>Only a few decades ago, Britain was the proud possessor of an empire
that spanned the world. Today, that empire has gone, the monarchy is under
threat, and the nation&rsquo;s sovereignty is being surrendered to a
supranational Europe dominated by Germany.</P>

<P>What has happened to this once great nation of Britain? What lay behind
the foundation of the greatest Empire the world has ever seen? And why today
is Britain a nation that has lost its way, with no clearly defined purpose
in the world? Here, at a time when Britain&rsquo;s leaders, political and
ecclesiastic, have no solution to her problems, is a book that provides the
answer.</P>

<P>Here is an inspiring, almost incredible, story that will bring untold
faith and blessing to all who have lost hope in our land and national
existence. Only in this interpretation of history will be found the answer
to Britain&rsquo;s national predicament.</p>

<A HREF="cause+con.htm"><H4>Causes and Consequences of Revival</H4></A>

<P>What is to be done when the peace and prosperity of a nation is disturbed
by a massive onslaught of its enemies &mdash; by people displaying
ingratitude and injustice and motivated by evil?</P>

<P>The situation in southern Africa in the late 20th century &mdash; and in
the Christian nations of the world today &mdash; finds a counterpart in the
Bible story of a king of Judah whose nation was oppressed and intimidated by
a host of enemies.</P>

<P>Relying not upon military power but on God, the king called the people
together to seek divine help. What happened as a result was a glorious
revival &mdash; a spiritual awakening in which the people turned to God with
enthusiasm and great rejoicing, resulting in the total overthrow of their
enemies.</P>

<P>The extraordinary nature of their deliverance sets the pattern for
revival today. God will not solve the nation&rsquo;s problems until we
realize the futility of our own efforts. God is waiting for us to recognize
and acknowledge Him and our entire dependence upon Him for deliverance. Only
then can victory&nbsp;come.</P>

<h4>How You Can Receive God&rsquo;s Power<br>
<font size=-1>The baptism and gifts of the Holy Spirit</font></h4></A>

<P>The Baptism in the Holy Spirit is for every Christian, regardless of race, sex or denomination. The disciples of the early Church could not do without this experience, and neither can we. The &ldquo;Baptism in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; may be a theological misnomer &mdash; for every baptized, converted Christian has received the Holy Spirit &mdash; but the experience is real and will change your life.</P>

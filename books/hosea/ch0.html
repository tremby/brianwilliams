</H1><hr>
&nbsp;<BR>
In the prophetic books of the Bible there are four Major prophets,
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel, and twelve Minor (i.e. shorter)
prophets, of which Hosea is the first. The writings of these twelve were
originally counted as one book. The first five antedate the major
prophets.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Hosea prophesied to the northern House of Israel over a very
long period of perhaps 65 years. He commenced when Uzziah was king over
Judah and Jeroboam II king over Israel. His ministry closed sometime before
Samaria fell in 722<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Hosea had his own personal sorrows: he married a faithless
wife. His sufferings express God&rsquo;s pain at the faithlessness of His
people. It is reflected in his style. Where he speaks of God&rsquo;s
judgments which will fall on the nation, the Hebrew is very terse and brief,
concise and broken, and so not easy to understand. Where he speaks of
God&rsquo;s mercy, his style is quite different, easy and flowing. Hosea is
the prophet of the tenderness of the love of God.<p>

<h3>The background to Hosea</H3>

&nbsp; &nbsp;This eighth century before Christ was the darkest period
of Israel&rsquo;s history. There was anarchy and misrule. Kings made their
way to the throne by murdering their predecessors and then were murdered in
their turn. Shallum slew Zachariah (2&nbsp;Kings 15:10), Menahem slew
Shallum (2&nbsp;Kings 15:14), Pekah slew Pekahiah the son of Menahem
(2&nbsp;Kings 15:25), Hoshea slew Pekah (2&nbsp;Kings 15:30).<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;The whole kingdom of Israel was a military despotism. Baasha,
Zimri, Omri, Jehu, Menahem, Pekah all held military office before becoming
king. Each usurper made alliances with foreign nations, thereby increasing
idolatry. False religions were encouraged by the corrupt rival worship set
up by Jeroboam I, Israel&rsquo;s first king after the ten tribes had split
from the two in Judah. Everywhere was deceit, sexual immorality, murder,
robbery, mugging, bribery and corruption. The idolatrous priests were part
of this. Corruption spread throughout the land.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;This was the condition of the people among whom Hosea
prophesied for a lifetime, yet they were oblivious of their moral, spiritual
and political decay. They sought alliances with Assyria, and Hosea warned
them that Assyria would destroy them. There would be no reprieve. Not one of
Israel&rsquo;s kings would risk his throne by calling the people to give up
their idolatry. The kingdom lasted 216 years, then Israel was taken into
captivity. <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Chapter 13 closes with Hosea&rsquo;s prophecy of the utter
destruction of Samaria and of the horrible cruelties her people would
endure. The last chapter predicts a future conversion of Israel which, as we
shall see, began to be fulfilled from the time of Christ and does not refer
to some postulated mass conversion of the Jews at the end of the age.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;The importance of Hosea is that he lived in a day very like our
own, in the death-throes of the church and nation.<p>

<h3>Hosea the key to prophecy</H3>

&nbsp; &nbsp;The key to understanding the Bible may be said to be
contained in three chapters: 2&nbsp;Kings 17 speaking of the end of the
House of Israel, Hosea&nbsp;1 prophesying the two quite different destinies
of Israel and Judah, and Romans&nbsp;11 in which the apostle Paul assures us
that God has not cast away His people Israel.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;God&rsquo;s plan is nothing less than the salvation of the
whole world. To accomplish this purpose He first reveals Himself to a man
Abraham and then creates a nation&mdash;Israel. In the divine economy the
nation becomes split into two quite different peoples, the House of Judah
and the House of Israel. From Judah comes Messiah, Lion of the Tribe of
Judah (Rev 5:5). From the House of Israel comes the people, the Church, who
will embody Christ and give Him to the world.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;The theme of Hosea then is the casting off of Israel, their
banishment from their homeland and&mdash;centuries later&mdash;their
remarriage to Christ. Then, oblivious of their true identity and therefore
having nothing to boast of in accepting Christ, they would become His true
servants in the world.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;If this interpretation of Hosea is <I>true</I>&mdash;and it is
the same truth given by revelation to all the prophets&mdash;then it follows
that Israel today is to be found a Christian people (not all converted, of
course).<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;This counteracts two great errors common in Biblical teaching
today&mdash; first that school of thought which insists on spiritualizing
all the promises made to Israel by applying them to the Church, and second
that of evangelical fundamentalists who aggressively apply God&rsquo;s
promises to the modern Israeli state in Palestine as &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
chosen people&rdquo; and so dictate American foreign policy.<p>

<h3>The meaning of Hosea for today</H3>

&nbsp; &nbsp;The argument of this small book is not against the <I>de
facto</I> state of Israel or its right to exist but to posit a fresh and
exciting understanding of prophecy and God&rsquo;s calling of our people to
loving Christian service.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;This message of Hosea has special application to Anglo-Saxon,
Celtic, Scandinavian and some German peoples, and to the United States of
America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and southern Africa&mdash;and to
Christians in every land who love God&rsquo;s truth. Only in this
interpretation of prophecy will be found the answer to our nation&rsquo;s
predicament and need for a sense of national vocation.<p>

<h3>MAP: the separate migrations of Israel and Judah</h3>

<IMG SRC="pix/migrations600.gif" ALT="The separate migrations of Israel and Judah - 19Kb" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=471 BORDER=0 ALIGN="BOTTOM">
&nbsp;<br>

<P>All of 10-tribed <B>Israel</B> was deported to Assyria and Media in 722<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL> <SMALL>(2&nbsp;Kings 15&ndash;18)</SMALL>, and some of the fenced cities of Judah were taken as well <SMALL>(2&nbsp;Kings 18:13</SMALL>). They never returned. The people are reported near the River Araxes around 650<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL> and later near Lake Van. They passed through the mountains of present Kurdistan to skirt the Black Sea <SMALL>(2&nbsp;Esdras 13:40&ndash;45)</SMALL> and left evidence in the Crimea, before migrating northwest through the land of Sereth, what today is the Ukraine <SMALL>(2&nbsp;Esdras 13:45)</SMALL>.</p>

<P>By contrast, <B>Judah</B> was deported to Babylon between 606 and 587<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL> <SMALL>(2&nbsp;Kings 24&ndash;25, 2&nbsp;Chronicles 36)</SMALL>. Seventy years later, under decree of Cyrus, some of the captives returned to Palestine <SMALL>(Ezra 1&ndash;8)</SMALL> and since then have been known as Jews. Two practices unknown before the captivity came back with them from Babylon: the custom of meeting in synagogues and the charging of usury.

Britain in Covenant relationship to God

&nbsp; &nbsp;These and many other passages from the Prayer Book express
the spiritual and historic truth that in the New Testament dispensation the
House of Israel has become a redeemed, Christian people.<P>


&nbsp; &nbsp;The founders of our British Church prepared its services as for
the worship of the New Israel, a people which has embraced the faith of
Jesus Christ and come under the New Covenant. The Prayer Book is thus an
affirmation of our national faith, and its purpose is to bring every
individual to know Christ and to believe His promises.<P>


&nbsp; &nbsp;This, and the fact that the Church of England is the
Established Church of these Islands, means that our people are placed, as it
were, in Covenant relationship to God. Grave consequences must follow our
abnegation of that responsibility. But we also have the surest promise of
spiritual renewal <I>(2&nbsp;Chronicles 7:14)</I>.<p>

<CENTER><H6>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H6>
<H1>THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF ISRAEL</H1>
<H3>Hosea 13 shows Israel reborn by Messiah&rsquo;s death and resurrection</H3></CENTER>
<hr><BR><BR>

&ldquo;<B>When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died</B>&rdquo; <I>(v1)</I>. Ephraim&rsquo;s pride caused the separation from Judah. Israel&rsquo;s first king Jeroboam (938&ndash;916<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>) introduced Calf-worship <I>(v2, 1&nbsp;Kings 19:18)</I>. Ahab (874&ndash;852<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>), through his alliance with the king of Sidon, brought in Baal-worship <I>(1&nbsp;Kings 16:29&ndash;33, see also 2&nbsp;Kings 10, esp 18&ndash;36)</I>. Now there was a proliferation of idols <I>(2&nbsp;Kings 17:9&ndash;12)</I>, and they sinned more and more <I>(v2)</I>.<H3><P>

Israel to vanish

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;When he offended in [the worship of] Baal, he <B>died</B>&rdquo; <I>(v1)</I>. Ephraim&rsquo;s sin was pride <I>(5:5, 7:10)</I>. God knew them in the wilderness, had given them all they ever wanted <I>(Psalm 106:15)</I>, but they were proud and had forgotten God <I>(v6)</I>. Now the nation would <B>die</B> <I>(v9)</I>. &ldquo;The wages of sin is <B>death</B>&rdquo; <I>(Romans 6:23)</I>, separation from God, i.e. loss of the consciousness of God, and the divine life of which He is the source. So they would be as the morning cloud and early dew, as chaff driven before the whirlwind and smoke out of the chimney <I>(v3)</I>: they would <B>vanish</B>. Note: So completely did 10-tribed Israel vanish that the Jews to this day pray that they may be found (see <I>Britain in Prophecy</I>, pages 20&ndash;21).<H3><P>

Jesus Saviour of Israel

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>Yet I am the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but Me: for there is no saviour beside me</B>&rdquo; <I>(v4)</I>. He their God would yet be their Saviour! &ldquo;See now that I, even I, am He, and there is no god with Me&rdquo; <I>(Deuteronomy 32:39)</I>. &ldquo;I am the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>: that is My name: and My glory will I not give to another, neither My praise to graven images&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 42:8)</I>. &ldquo;Ye are My witnesses, saith the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>, and My servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He: before Me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after Me. I, even I, am the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>; and beside Me there is no saviour&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 43:10)</I>.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;There is no God else beside Me; a just God and a <B>Saviour</B>; there is none beside Me. Look unto Me, and be ye <B>saved</B>, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 45:21&ndash;22)</I>. Who is He? &ldquo;Thou shalt call His name <B>Jesus</B>: for He shall <B>save his people</B> [Israel] from their sins&rdquo; <I>(Matthew 1:21)</I>. &ldquo;For there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be <B>saved</B>&rdquo; <I>(Acts 4:12)</I>. Note: Jesus (Greek IhsouV) = Joshua (Hebrew&nbsp;&ograve;&lArr;&Oslash;dagger&Ccedil;&auml;&eacute;X&nbsp;<I>Yah-oshea</I>), the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> saves.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death</B>: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction&rdquo; <I>(v14, cf 1&nbsp;Corinthians  15:55)</I>. &ldquo;He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord G<SMALL>OD</SMALL> [&nbsp;&auml;&aring;&auml;&eacute;&nbsp;] will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of His people [Israel] shall He take away from off all the earth: for the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> hath spoken it&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 25:8, 1&nbsp;Corinthians  15:54)</I>.<H3><P>

Israel lost to the world
</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;Deported into Assyria, Israel would <B>die</B> and be lost to the world. But the Creator, the Holy One of Israel, Jesus Christ her Messiah, would shed His precious Blood and die for her. So Israel&rsquo;s death would become the gateway to their salvation, not a temporal deliverance and return to Palestine, but their eternal salvation through <B>Christ</B> <I>(Hebrews 2:14&ndash;15)</I>. They would be <B>ransomed</B> and <B>redeemed</B>, a <B>Christian</B> people.<P>

<CENTER><H6>CHAPTER FIVE</H6>
<H1>THE FUTURE OF ISRAEL REVEALED</H1>
<h3>Hosea 5 shows us the wonderful fulfilment of prophecy</h3></CENTER>
<hr><br><br>

&ldquo;<B>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from Me</B>: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled&rdquo; <I>(v3)</I>. Priests, people and king were all guilty of bloodshed <I>(v1&ndash;2)</I>, whoredom <I>(v3&ndash;4),</I> pride and arrogance (v5), apostasy <I>(v7)</I>. They shall fall <I>(v5)</I>, be forsaken <I>(v6)</I> and laid waste <I>(v9)</I>. Ephraim moth-eaten and Judah rotten <I>(v12)</I>, political alliances could not save them <I>(v13)</I>. They would be torn and dragged away into captivity <I>(v14, 2&nbsp;Kings 17:5&ndash;23, 18:9&ndash;12)</I>. Note: Ephraim was the largest tribe and hence a synonym for the nation of Israel.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord G<SMALL>OD</SMALL> [&nbsp;&auml;&aring;&auml;&eacute;&nbsp;] ... within threescore and five years [735-670<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>] shall <B>Ephraim</B> be broken, that it be <B>not a people</B>. ... If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established. ... Hear ye now, O House of <B>David</B> ... the Lord Himself shall give you a sign; Behold, <B>a virgin shall conceive</B>,<B> and bear a son</B>, and shall call His name <B>Immanuel</B>. [But before then] the land ... shall be forsaken of both her kings&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 7:7&ndash;16, cf Matthew 1:20&ndash;23)</I>.<H3><P>

Israel sifted among the nations

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;Within 65 years the 10-tribed House of <B>Israel</B> would be <B>not a people</B> <I>(1:9)</I>. Taken captive into Assyria, they migrated <I>(2 Esdras 13:40&ndash;45)</I> beyond Euphrates into Asia Minor, &ldquo;an immense multitude not to be estimated by numbers&rdquo; <I>(Josephus XI,5,2, cf 1:10)</I>. &ldquo;For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the House of <B>Israel</B> among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, <B>yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth</B>&rdquo; <I>(Amos 9:9, cf Jeremiah 31:33&ndash;37)</I>. These lost sheep of the House of <B>Israel</B> were the <B>Christians</B> to whom Peter and Paul wrote <I>(1&nbsp;Peter 1:1, Gal 1:2).<H3><P>

Israel turns to Christ

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>Among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be</I></B>&rdquo;<B><I></B></I> <I>(v9, cf Amos 3:7)</I>. &ldquo;I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known. ... [I will] not forsake them&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 42:16)</I>. &ldquo;This people have I formed for Myself; <B>they shall shew forth My praise</B>&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 43:21, cf 1&nbsp;Peter 2:9)</I>. In the lands of their dispersion&mdash;the islands and coastlands&mdash;they would be brought into the New Covenant and remarried to Christ <I>(Hebrews 8:10)</I>. In the last days <I>(Genesis 49:1)</I> <B>Ephraim&ndash;Israel</B> would become the <B>sons of God</B>, <B>Christians</B>!<I> (1:10)</I>. But <B>Judah</B>, through whom came <B>Messiah</B>, would remain in unbelief <I>(John 1:11)</I>. Note: Hebrew &ccedil;&lArr;&eacute;&Oslash;&cedil;&icirc;OElig <I>Messiah</I> = Greek CristoV <I>Christos</I>, anointed one.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>I will go and return to My place, till they acknowledge their offence</B>,<B> and seek My face</B>: in their affliction they will seek Me early [&nbsp;&oslash;&ccedil;&lArr;&Oslash;OElig <I>shachar</I> = seek earnestly]&rdquo; <I>(v15)</I>. &ldquo;Hath God cast away <B>His people</B>? God forbid. ... God hath <B>not</B> cast away <B>His people</B> which He <B>foreknew</B>&rdquo; <I>(Romans 11:1&ndash;2, 25, cf Genesis 48:19)</I>. The lineal seed of the old House of Israel, blind to their identity, were to become the nucleus of the <B>new Israel</B>, the <B>Church of God</B>, into which <B>all</B> might enter through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ <I>(Galatians 3:26&ndash;29)</I>.<H3><P>

Proof of inspiration of Scripture

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;For I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like Me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all My pleasure. ... I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 46:9&ndash;11)</I>. The fulfilment of prophecy is the surest proof of the inspiration of scripture.

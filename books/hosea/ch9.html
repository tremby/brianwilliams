&ldquo;<B>Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people</B>: <B>for thou
hast gone a whoring from thy God</B>&rdquo; (<I>v1)</I>. &ldquo;Surely as a
wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt
treacherously with Me, O house of <B>Israel</B>, saith the
L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>&rdquo; <I>(Jeremiah 3:20)</I>. ISRAEL was <B>married</B>
to the Lord <I>(Jeremiah 3:14)</I>; now she would be <B>divorced</B> (but
not JUDAH), and sent away <I>(Jeremiah 3:8),</I> deported to Assyria under
Tiglath-pileser III <I>(2&nbsp;Kings 15:29, 1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:26)</I>,
Shalmaneser V <I>(2&nbsp;Kings 17:3)</I> and Sargon II <I>(Isaiah 20:1)</I>.
There they would be reduced to the utmost poverty.

<H3>Jesus&rsquo; parables of the Kingdom

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>And they shall eat unclean things in
Assyria</B>&rdquo; <I>(v3)</I>. &ldquo;And he would fain have filled his
belly with the husks that the swine did eat&rdquo; <I>(Luke 15:16)</I>.
Note: the <B>prodigal son</B> is ISRAEL; his elder brother, JUDAH <I>(Luke
15:11)</I>. How many of Jesus&rsquo; parables express the truth of His
<B>rejection</B> of the JEWS (remnant of <B>Judah</B>) and <B>conversion</B>
of the House of ISRAEL?<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;<B>The two sons</B> <I>(Matthew 21:28&ndash;32)</I>. The first
said he would go to work but didn&rsquo;t (Jews), the second said he
wouldn&rsquo;t go but did (Israel). <B>The vineyard</B> <I>(Matthew
21:33&ndash;44)</I>, taken away from the husbandmen in possession (Jews) who
kill the owner (Jesus), and given to other husbandmen (Israel) who render
Him the fruits. <B>The ten virgins</B> <I>(Matthew 25:1&ndash;13)</I>. All
(Judah and Israel) had lamps: the five wise (Israel) went in to the
marriage, the five foolish (Jews) were shut out because their oil had run
out. <B>The rich man and Lazarus</B> <I>(Luke 16:19&ndash;31)</I>. Both
died: the beggar (Israel) was received into Abraham&rsquo;s bosom, the rich
man (Jews) was tormented.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Note: The Bible frequently calls ISRAEL the <B>vine
<I>(10:1)</I> </B>and JUDAH the <B>fig&nbsp;tree</B> <I>(e.g. Psalm 80:8,
Jeremiah 24)</I>; the Jews knew this symbolism. &ldquo;When [Jesus] saw a
fig tree in the way, He came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves
only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And
presently the fig tree withered away&rdquo; <I>(Matthew 21:19)</I>. Jesus
explained his action by telling the parable of the vineyard <I>(Matthew
21:33&ndash;44)</I>. The fig tree&mdash;the Jewish nation&mdash;bore leaves
but <B>no fruit</B>; it would die. Jesus said, &ldquo;The Kingdom of God
shall be taken from you [Jews], and given to a nation [Israel] <B>bringing
forth the fruits</B> thereof&rdquo; <I>(Matthew 21:43)</I>.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Luke&rsquo;s version is even stronger: A certain man [Jesus]
had a fig tree [Jews] planted in his vineyard [all Israel]; the fig tree was
<B>barren</B>. He had come three years seeking fruit and found none. It
would be left for a fourth year for His special attention; if it still did
not bear fruit it would be cut down. After three and a half years of
Jesus&rsquo; ministry the Jews rejected Him, bringing about the cutting down
of their fig tree <I>(Luke 13:6&ndash;10)</I>. Jesus wept over Jerusalem
<I>(Luke 19:41)</I>; the Jewish nation was destroyed in
<SMALL>AD&nbsp;</SMALL>70.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>My God will cast them away</B>,<B> because they did
not hearken unto Him</B>:<B> and they shall be wanderers among the
nations</B>&rdquo; <I>(v17)</I>. The errant wife&mdash;ISRAEL&mdash;is
divorced, cast off, sent away. But Jesus dies for her, redeems her, wins her
back, nullifies the divorce <I>(Isaiah 50:1)</I>. He makes a New Covenant
with her <I>(Jeremiah&nbsp;31:31&ndash;33, Hebrews&nbsp;10:16)</I>,
remarries her <I>(2:19)</I>; she becomes a <B>Christian</B> people. But the
JEWS reject the New Covenant.<H3><P>

Judah deported to Babylon

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;In that day, saith the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>, will I
<B>assemble</B> her that <B>halteth</B> [Judah], and I will <B>gather</B>
her that is <B>driven out and</B> ... <B>afflicted</B>; and I will make her
that halted a <B>remnant</B>, and her that was cast far off [Israel] a
<B>strong nation</B>&rdquo; <I>(Micah 4:6&ndash;7)</I>. JUDAH halted, i.e.
did not wholly apostatize, so was deported to Babylon in
604<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>, and a remnant&mdash;from then on known as
JEWS&mdash;allowed to return in 534<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>. ISRAEL, wholly
apostate, would be deported to Assyria,
735&ndash;670<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>, but become a strong nation
[&nbsp;&eacute;&Egrave;&Atilde; <I>goi</I> = gentile], embracing the faith
of the Lord Jesus Christ and becoming the nucleus of the Church and Kingdom
of God on earth <I>(1&nbsp;Peter 2:9&ndash;10)</I>.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little
among the thousands of <B>Judah</B>, yet out of thee shall He [Messiah] come
forth unto Me that is to be ruler in <B>Israel</B>; whose goings forth have
been from of old, from everlasting. Therefore will He <B>give them up</B>
[Jews], until the time that <B>she which travaileth</B> [Israel] hath
brought forth: then the <B>remnant</B> of His brethren [Jews] shall return
unto the children of Israel&rdquo; <I>(Micah 5:2&ndash;3)</I>. Israel is
under the New Covenant&mdash;Christians!

<CENTER><H6>CHAPTER EIGHT</H6>
<H1>THE DOWNFALL OF ISRAEL</H1><H3><BR>
Hosea 8 reminds us that Israel&rsquo;s downfall is all part of God&rsquo;s plan</H3></CENTER>
<hr><BR><BR>

&ldquo;<B>He shall come as an eagle against the house of the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B>, because they have transgressed My covenant, and trespassed against My law&rdquo; <I>(v1)</I>. Israel had rejected the law <I>(v3, 12)</I>, worshipped idols <I>(v4)</I>, set up a golden calf <I>(v5)</I>, tried to appease Assyria <I>(v9, cf 2&nbsp;Kings 15:19, 1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:26)</I>, sought alliances with other nations <I>(v10)</I>. They claimed to be His people <I>(v2)</I>, but had forgotten Him <I>(v14)</I>; now they must suffer the awful consequences. Read Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28 to understand this.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them ... [then] I will walk among you, and will be <B>your God</B>, and ye shall be <B>My people</B>&rdquo; <I>(Leviticus 26:3, 12).</I> But &ldquo;if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> thy God, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes ... [then] the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the <B>eagle</B> flieth&rdquo; <I>(Deuteronomy 28:15, 49; Jeremiah 5:15&ndash;18)</I>.<H3><P>

The division of the kingdom

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>They have set up kings</B>,<B> but not by Me: they have made princes</B>,<B> and I knew it not</B> <I>(v4)</I>. The 10-tribed House of ISRAEL set up their own monarchy in 938<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>; it was not of the Davidic line of the House of JUDAH through whom Messiah would come <I>(Genesis 49:10, 1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:2, Luke 2:11)</I>; it ended with the fall of Samaria in 722<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>. Read 1&nbsp;Kings 11, especially 30&ndash;36.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Thus saith the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>, Ye [House of <B>Judah</B>] shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren, the children of <B>Israel</B>: return every man to his house; <B>for this thing is from Me</B>&rdquo; <I>(1&nbsp;Kings 12:24)</I>. The division of Israel into the House of ISRAEL (10 tribes) and JUDAH (2 tribes) was divinely foreordained from the beginning&mdash;&ldquo;When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; JUDAH was His <B>sanctuary</B>, and ISRAEL His <B>dominion</B>&rdquo; <I>(Psalm 114:1&ndash;2)</I>. They were <B>two</B> separate and distinct nations, fulfilling entirely different destinies.<H3><P>

Potter re-makes one, smashes the other

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure</B>&rdquo; <I>(v8)</I>. &ldquo;Go down to the potter&rsquo;s house, and there I will cause thee to hear My words. ... And the vessel that he made of clay was <B>marred</B> in the hand of the potter: so <B>he made it again</B> [into] <B>another vessel</B>, as seemed good to the potter to make it. ... O House of <B>Israel</B>, cannot I do with you as this potter?&rdquo; <I>(Jeremiah 18:2&ndash;6)</I>.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Go and get a potter&rsquo;s earthen bottle ... , and say, Hear ye the word of the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>, O kings of <B>Judah</B>, and inhabitants of <B>Jerusalem</B> ... Even so will I <B>break</B> this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter&rsquo;s vessel, that <B>cannot be made whole again</B>&rdquo; <I>(Jeremiah 19:1)</I>. Note clearly: <B>Israel</B> would be <B>re-made</B> to become in the last days the sons of God, Christians <I>(1:10)</I>; the <B>Jews</B>, i.e. remnant of <B>Judah</B>, would be <B>broken</B> <I>(Luke 19:27)</I>. Read Romans 9:18&ndash;26.<H3><P>

God keeps His promises

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;Is God faithful? Does He keep His promises? Isaiah the Bible <B>true</B>? &ldquo;The gifts and calling of God are without repentance&rdquo; <I>(Romans 11:29)</I>. &ldquo;Jesus Christ [came not to annul but] to <B>confirm</B> the <B>promises made unto the fathers</B>: and that the Gentiles might glorify God for His <B>mercy</B>&rdquo; <I>(Romans 15:8&ndash;9, Hosea 2:23)</I>. The House of Israel had to become as gentiles that they&mdash; and we&mdash;might <B>believe</B> the Gospel and be <B>saved</B> by <B>grace</B> through <B>faith</B>!<P>

<H1>THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL REDEEMED<BR></H1>
<H3>Hosea 3 shows exiled, divorced Israel becoming Christians
</H3></CENTER>
<HR><BR><BR>

&ldquo;<B>So I bought her to Me for fifteen pieces of silver</B>, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley&rdquo; <I>(v2)</I>. Hosea took back his unfaithful wife, though she was of little worth: the price of a servant was 30 shekels <I>(Exodus 21:32, cf Zechariah 11:12&ndash;13, Matthew 26:15).</I> So the Lord tells His divorced wife, the House of ISRAEL (not Judah) that she is presently of little value, but gives her sufficient for her continued existence; she is to abide [&nbsp;&aacute;&Oslash;&eacute; <I>yashab</I> = settle down] and wait for Him for many days <I>(v3)</I>. Then He will come and die for her, to <B>redeem</B> her.<H3><P>

Israel to become gentiles!

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince</B>, and without a sacrifice, and without an image [&nbsp;&auml;&aacute;OElig&Otilde;1&icirc;&lArr; <I>matstsebah</I> = pillar, sacred stone, <I>cf Genesis 28:18</I>], and without an ephod, and without teraphim&rdquo; (<I>v4)</I>. Israel must wait for Him <B>many days</B> <I>(v3)</I>; they shall be without a king <B>many days</B>&mdash;but not for ever. Meanwhile, in the lands of their exile, they shall be as gentiles. &ldquo;We are become as they <B>over whom Thou never barest rule</B>; as they that were <B>not called by Thy name</B>&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 63:19 RV)</I>.<H3><P>

Who then are the Jews?

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;Samaria, capital of ten-tribed ISRAEL, fell to the Assyrians in the spring of 722<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>. It had no king thereafter. The House of Israel was deported and <B>never returned</B> to Palestine. The House of JUDAH, and its Davidic monarchy, was saved at this time <I>(1:7)</I> and survived until 604<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL> when Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians. The two-tribed House of Judah was taken captive to Babylon, from which a remnant (only 50,000, <I>Ezra 1:5 and 2:1, 54&ndash;65)</I> returned 70 years later in 534<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>; they were henceforth known as <B>Jews</B>.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> their God, and David their king</B>; and shall fear the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> and His goodness in the <B>latter</B> [&nbsp;&uacute;&eacute;&oslash;&cedil;&ccedil;oelig&agrave;&lArr; <I>acharith</I> = last] <B>days</B> <I>(v5)</I>. When are the <B>last days</B>? &ldquo;God hath in these <B>last days</B> spoken unto us by His Son&rdquo; <I>(Hebrews 1:2)</I>. &ldquo;And it shall come to pass in the <B>last days</B>, saith God, that I will pour out of My Spirit&rdquo; <I>(Acts 2:17, cf Joel 2:28)</I>. Christ &ldquo;was manifest in these <B>last times</B> for you&rdquo; <I>(1&nbsp;Peter 1:20)</I>. The <B>last days</B> are the Christian dispensation.<H3><P>

Sons of the living God

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the <B>last days</B> Israel shall be &ldquo;a multitude in the midst of the earth&rdquo; <I>(Genesis 49:1, 48:16)</I>, &ldquo;as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered&rdquo; <I>(Hosea 1:10)</I>. They will then be &ldquo;the <B>sons of the living God</B>&rdquo; <I>(1:10)</I>, a <B>redeemed</B>, i.e. Christian, people. &ldquo;Thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall save <B>His people</B> from their sins&rdquo; <I>(Matthew 1:21)</I>. &ldquo;Blessed be the Lord God of <B>Israel</B>; for He hath visited and <B>redeemed His people</B>, and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant <B>David</B>&rdquo; <I>(Luke 1:68&ndash;69)</I>.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;And it shall be at that day, saith the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>, that thou shalt call me Ishi [my Husband]; and shalt call Me no more Baali [my lord]&rdquo; <I>(2:16)</I>. &ldquo;And I will sow her unto Me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not My people, Thou art My people; and they shall say, Thou art my God&rdquo; <I>(2:23, cf 1:9)</I>. So Christ came &ldquo;to confirm the promises made unto the Fathers&rdquo; <I>(Romans 15:8)</I>. From JUDAH came forth <B>Messiah</B>; from ISRAEL came forth the <B>Church</B> and foundation of the Kingdom of God on earth.<P>

<CENTER><H6>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</H6>
<H1>ISRAEL RETURNS TO THE LORD</H1>
<H3>Hosea 14 reveals the New Israel as a redeemed Christian people</H3></CENTER>
<hr><BR><BR>

&ldquo;<B>O Israel, return unto the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity</B>&rdquo; <I>(v1)</I>. They must turn back to God, confess their sins, seek His forgiveness, receive His pardon, give Him thanks and praise <I>(v2)</I>, acknowledge their helplessness, abandon their idols and love Him, Messiah, <B>Jesus</B>, as their <B>Father</B> <I>(v3)</I>. (Note: every individual may do this and be assured of Christ&rsquo;s acceptance.)<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;This would not happen for a long time&mdash;in fact, seven and a half centuries. First they must be exiled, dispersed, lose their identity, become a &ldquo;multitude of nations&rdquo; <I>(Genesis 48:19)</I> &mdash;Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;fulness of the Gentiles&rdquo; <I>(Romans 11:25)</I>&mdash;then in their new homelands, receive the Gospel, accept Messiah, and be re-covenanted to God to become <B>a Christian people</B>, the <B>new</B> Israel, nucleus of the <B>Church</B> and foundation of God&rsquo;s Kingdom on earth. When would this be? &ldquo;Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> their God, and David [Messiah] their king; and shall fear the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> and His goodness <B>in the latter days</B>&rdquo; <I>(3:5)&mdash;</I>the Christian dispensation!<H3><P>

Israel a Christian people

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Thus saith the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after Me in the wilderness&rdquo; <I>(Jeremiah 2:2)</I>. &ldquo;I will remember My covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant&rdquo; <I>(Ezekiel 16:60)</I>. &ldquo;But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>, I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be My people. ... For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more&rdquo; <I>(Jeremiah 31:33&ndash;34; Hebrews 8:10, 10:16)</I>.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for Mine anger is turned away from him</B>&rdquo; <I>(v4)</I>. He would be to Israel as the dew: they would be beautiful as the lily, strong as a mountain <I>(v5)</I>, lovely as the olive tree, fragrant as the perfumes of Lebanon <I>(v6)</I>. Under His shadow they would spring up as the corn, grow as the vine: be sweet as the wine of Lebanon <I>(v7)</I>. &ldquo;This people have I formed for Myself; they <B>shall</B> shew forth My praise&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 43:21, cf 1&nbsp;Peter 2:9)</I>.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them?</B>&rdquo; <I>(v9)</I>. &ldquo;For the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> will not cast off His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance&rdquo; <I>(Psalm 94:14, see also Jeremiah 31:35&ndash;37)</I>. &ldquo;Hath God cast away His people? God forbid. ... God hath not cast away His people which He foreknew&rdquo; <I>(Romans 11:1&ndash;2)</I>. &ldquo;Then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures&rdquo; <I>(Luke 24:45)</I>. Only <B>He</B> can teach us <I>(John 14:26)</I>. Review these notes often: History is <B>His</B> story!<H3><P>

Britain the first to receive the Gospel

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;Church Fathers and historians claim that Britain received the Gospel in the first century. &ldquo;The regions of Britain ... have received the religion of Christ&rdquo; <I>(Tertullian, <SMALL>AD</SMALL> 155&ndash;222)</I>. &ldquo;The Apostles passed beyond the ocean to the isles called the Britannic Isles&rdquo; <I>(Eusebius, 260&ndash;340)</I>. &ldquo;Christ, the True Sun, afforded His light, the knowledge of His precepts, to our Island in the last year, as we know, of Tiberius Caesar&rdquo; <I>(Gildas, 425&ndash;512)</I>. &ldquo;Britain, partly through Joseph of Arimathaea, ... was of all kingdoms the first that received the Gospel&rdquo; <I>(Polydore Vergil, 1470&ndash;1555)</I>.<P>

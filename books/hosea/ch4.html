<CENTER><H6>CHAPTER FOUR</H6>
<H1>GOD&rsquo;S INDICTMENT OF ISRAEL</H1><BR>
<H3>Hosea 4 shows us how sin and ignorance caused Israel&rsquo;s downfall</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR><BR><BR>

&ldquo;<B>Hear the Word of the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>, ye children of Israel</B>: for the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land&rdquo; <I>(v1)</I>. There was no truth, mercy or knowledge of God in the land; it was full of swearing, lying, killing, stealing, sexual depravity, endless murders <I>(v2)</I>, with devastating effect on the environment&mdash;&ldquo;the beasts of the field ... the fowls of heaven ... the fishes of the sea&rdquo; <I>(v3)</I>. The nation was corrupted by sex and drink <I>(v11, cf Isaiah 28:7)</I>; it would fall and be destroyed <I>(v5)</I>, be carried away <I>(v19)</I>. &ldquo;The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 1:5)</I>. &ldquo;I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against Me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master&rsquo;s crib: but <B>Israel</B> doth not know, <B>My people</B> doth not consider&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 1:2&ndash;3)</I>.<H3><P>

Israel&rsquo;s national vocation

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge</B>&rdquo; <I>(v6)</I>. They are <B>His people</B>, specially chosen to serve Him, but ignorant of the fact. &ldquo;If ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people: for all the earth is Mine: and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and an <B>holy nation</B>&rdquo; <I>(Exodus 19:5&ndash;6)</I>. &ldquo;For thou art an <B>holy people</B> unto the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> thy God: the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> hath chosen thee to be a <B>special people</B> unto Himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth&rdquo; <I>(Deuteronomy 7:6, 14:2)</I>. &ldquo;Obey My voice, and do ... all which I command you: so shall ye be <B>My people</B>, and I will be <B>your God</B>&rdquo; <I>(Jeremiah 11:4)</I>. But Israel broke the Covenant; they did not know who they were; they had no sense of national vocation.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend</B>&rdquo; <I>(v15)</I>. ISRAEL was divorced, JUDAH was not. Both would go into captivity: Israel into Assyria 735&ndash;670<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL> from which she never returned, Judah into Babylon 604&ndash;585<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL> from which a remnant returned 70 years later, in 534<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>. But in the <B>last days</B> the divorced wife would inherit the unconditional promises made to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and Ephraim, and <B>in the lands of her dispersion she would come to Christ</B>. &ldquo;I am sought of them that asked not for Me; I am found of them that sought Me not. I said, Behold Me, Behold Me, <B>unto a nation that was not called by My name</B>&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 65:1)</I>.<H3><P>

Israel a multitude of nations

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>Ephraim</B> is joined to idols: let him alone&rdquo; <I>(v17)</I>. But in the <B>last days</B> Ephraim shall become a <B>multitude</B> [&nbsp;&agrave;w&igrave;&icirc;&cedil; <I>melo</I> = fulness] <B>of nations</B> [&nbsp;&iacute;&eacute;&Egrave;&Atilde; <I>goyim</I> = gentiles] <I>(Genesis 49:1, 48:19, cf Romans 11:25)</I> in the <B>isles of the sea</B> <I>(Isaiah 40:15, 41:1, 5, 42:4, 10, 12, 49:1 etc)</I>. &ldquo;Hear the word of the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>, O ye <B>nations</B>, and declare it in the <B>isles afar off</B>, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him&rdquo; <I>(Jeremiah 31:10, 33)</I>. So Israel would be brought into the New Covenant and <B>remarried</B> to Christ <I>(Hebrews 8:10)</I>. Note: In Romans 11:25 Jewish translators of the New Testament render the Greek plhrwma twn &rsquo;eqnwn, &rdquo;the fulness of the gentiles&rdquo;, into Hebrew as &iacute;&eacute;&Egrave;&Atilde;&auml;&lArr; &agrave;w&igrave;&icirc;&cedil;&nbsp;&mdash;exactly the same phrase as used for &ldquo;multitude of nations&rdquo; in Genesis 48:19.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate [exiled <B>Israel</B>] than the children of the married wife [<B>Judah</B>] ... . For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles ... . For thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. For thy Maker is thine <B>husband</B>; the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the <B>Holy One of Israel</B>; the <B>God of the whole earth</B>&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 54:1&ndash;5)</I>.<H3><P>

Where did Israel go?

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tribute of Jaua of Bit-Humri: Silver, gold, a golden bowl, golden goblets, a golden beaker, pitchers of gold, lead, sceptres for the king, and balsam-wood I received from him.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The Assyrians called Israel <I>Bit-Humri</I>, House of Omri, after one of Israel&rsquo;s most powerful kings&mdash;hence Khumri or <I>Cymry</I> (as Wales is called). The Phoenicians called them <I>Beth-Sakai</I>, House of Isaac&mdash;hence Sacae, or <I>Saxons</I>. Many such names indicate where &ldquo;lost&rdquo; Israel went.<P>

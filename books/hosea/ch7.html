<h6>CHAPTER SEVEN</h6>
<h1>GOD&rsquo;S JUDGMENT ON ISRAEL</H1>
<H3>Hosea 7 shows judgment must fall on the nation that forgets God</H3></CENTER>
<hr><BR><BR>

&ldquo;<B>When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered</B>,<B> and the wickedness of Samaria</B>&rdquo; <I>(v1)</I>. People and rulers were dishonest; thieves broke into homes, people were mugged in the street <I>(v2)</I>. There was drunkenness <I>(v5)</I>, immorality <I>(v4)</I>, corruption <I>(v3)</I> at every level of society. They never considered that God saw it all <I>(v2, Psalm 90:8)</I>. They were beset by their own wrongdoing <I>(v2)</I>. All their troubles were self-inflicted, the inevitable consequence of sin <I>(Proverbs 5:22)</I>, the rejection of God&rsquo;s Word and repudiation of His law <I>(8:12)</I>. This is our problem today.<h3><P>

The nation has lost its way

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You only have I known of all the families of the earth&rdquo; <I>(Amos 3:2)</I>. But they had lost their way in the world, were blind to their destiny, forgetful of all that the Lord had done for them. &ldquo;Their land also is full of silver and gold [money], neither is there any end of their treasures [possessions]; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots [cars]: their land also is full of idols [consumer goods]; they worship the work of their own hands&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 2:7&ndash;8)</I>.<H3><P>

Affluent but spiritually bankrupt
</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;This was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom [ie. Israel], <B>pride</B>,<B> fulness of bread</B> and <B>abundance of idleness</B> was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy&rdquo; <I>(Ezekiel 16:49)</I>. They were an affluent nation but morally and spiritually bankrupt. Now they must reap what they had sown <I>(Galatians 6:7, Psalm 9:17&ndash;18)</I>.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>There is none among them that calleth unto Me</B>&rdquo; <I>(v7)</I>. &ldquo;The pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and <B>they do not return to the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> their God</B>,<B> nor seek Him</B> for all this&rdquo;<I> (v10)</I>. &ldquo;<B>They have not cried unto Me with their heart</B>, when they howled upon their beds&rdquo; <I>(v14)</I>. Israel had six kings between 752 and 731<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>: all were fallen, four assassinated <I>(2&nbsp;Kings 15:10, 14, 23&ndash;25, 30, see also Proverbs 28:2)</I>. Yet in spite of all their troubles no one prayed. No one recognized that the cause of all their problems was spiritual. &ldquo;And He saw that there was <B>no man</B>, and wondered that there was <B>no intercessor</B>&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 59:16, see also Ezekiel 22:30)</I>.<H3><P>

What is God saying to us today?
</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria</B>&rdquo; <I>(v11)</I>. &ldquo;Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; ... strangers have devoured his strength&rdquo; <I>(v8&ndash;9)</I>. They were a declining, dying nation <I>(v9)</I>, relying on false gods <I>(v14)</I> and alliances with other nations when only God could save them. &ldquo;Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; ... take counsel together, and it shall come to nought&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 8:9&ndash;10)</I>.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;What is God saying to us today? &ldquo;Blessed is the nation whose God is the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>; and the people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance&rdquo; <I>(Psalm 33:12)</I>. &ldquo;Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people&rdquo; <I>(Proverbs 14:34)</I>. &ldquo;If My people, which are called by My name, shall <B>humble</B> themselves, and <B>pray</B>, and <B>seek My face</B>, and <B>turn from their wicked ways</B>; then will I <B>hear</B> from heaven, and will <B>forgive</B> their sin, and will <B>heal</B> their land&rdquo; <I>(2&nbsp;Chronicles 7:14)</I>.<P>

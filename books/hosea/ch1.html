Hosea 1 shows us the contrasting destinies of Israel and Judah</CENTER><HR>

<H3>The role of the prophet
</H3>

&ldquo;<B>The Word of the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> that came unto Hosea</B>&rdquo;<B></B> (verse 1). &ldquo;The beginning of <B>the Word of the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> by Hosea</B>&rdquo;<B></B> (v2). Hosea was a <B>prophet</B> to the rival kingdoms of 10-tribed Israel and 2-tribed Judah. The prophet brings the <B>Word of the Lord</B>. He is <B>God&rsquo;s mouthpiece</B>. He speaks as <B>thus saith the Lord</B>. What he says <B>comes to pass</B> (Jeremiah 28:9). &ldquo;Surely the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> God will do nothing, but He <B>revealeth His secret</B> unto His servants the <B>prophets</B>&rdquo; (Amos 3:7 cf Psalm 25:14). &ldquo;Believe in the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> your God, so shall ye be established; believe His <B>prophets</B>, so shall ye prosper&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Chronicles 20:20). &ldquo;God hath set some in the Church, <B>prophets</B>&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Corinthians  12:28).<H3><P>

Israel married and divorced

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms&rdquo; (v2). Hosea enacts in his own life the tragedy of Yahweh and His wife. The Lord was <B>married</B> to Israel (Jeremiah 3:14). Now He would <B>divorce</B> her for adultery (Isaiah 50:1, Jeremiah 3:8). &ldquo;Call his name Jezreel [God scatters]. ... Call her name Lo-ruhamah [no mercy] (v6). ... Call his name Lo-ammi [not My people]&rdquo; (v9). Israel would be scattered, not His people, no more receive mercy.<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel</B>; but I will utterly take them away&rdquo; (v6). &ldquo;In the ninth year of Hoshea [722<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>], the king of Assyria [Shalmaneser] took Samaria and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and Habor and the cities of the Medes&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Kings 17:6, 18:9&ndash;11). &ldquo;The L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> removed Israel out of His sight, as He had said by all His servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria <B>unto this day</B>&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Kings 17:23). &ldquo;The L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> was very angry with Israel and removed them out of His sight. There was <B>none left but the tribe of Judah only</B>&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Kings 17:18).<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>I will have mercy upon the house of Judah</B>, and will save them&rdquo; (v7). <B>Israel</B> never again returned to Palestine. By contrast, <B>Judah</B> was saved at this time, not by bow, sword, battle, horses or horsemen (v7), but by miraculous deliverance (2&nbsp;Kings 18:13&ndash;19:37, 2&nbsp;Chronicles 32:1&ndash;22, Isaiah 36&ndash;37). The Lord&rsquo;s mercy to JUDAH would continue until their final rejection of Jesus in <SMALL>AD&nbsp;</SMALL>33 (see Matthew 21:43). What would happen to ISRAEL?<H3><P>

The House of Israel to become Christian

</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>There it shall be said unto them, ye are the sons of the living God</B>&rdquo; (v10). Who are the <B>sons of God</B>? &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the <B>sons of God</B>,&rdquo; to all who believe on His name (John 1:12). &ldquo;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the <B>sons of God</B>&rdquo; (Romans 8:19). &ldquo;That ye may be blameless and harmless, the <B>sons of God</B>&rdquo; (Philemon 2:15). &ldquo;Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the <B>sons of God</B>. Beloved, now are we the <B>sons of God</B>&rdquo; (1 John 3:1&ndash;2).<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The destiny of the exiled 10-tribed House of <B>Israel</B>, &ldquo;the lost sheep of the house of Israel&rdquo; (Matthew 10:6, 15:24), the &ldquo;other sheep I have, which are not of this [Jewish] fold&rdquo; (John 10:16), was to become <B>sons of God</B>, <B>Christians</B>. Thus they would become the nucleus of the New Israel, the <B>Church</B>&mdash;and foundation of the Kingdom of God on earth.<P>

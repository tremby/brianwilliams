<CENTER><h6>CHAPTER SIX</h6>
<h1>THE LORD PLEADS WITH ISRAEL</h1>
<h3>Hosea 6 shows us Hosea&rsquo;s call to Israel to return to the Lord</H3></CENTER>
<hr><br><br>

&ldquo;<B>Come, and let us return unto the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL></B>: for He hath torn, and He will <B>heal</B> us; He hath smitten, and He will bind us up&rdquo; <I>(v1)</I>. Then they would know the Lord <I>(v2)</I>; He would give them the Holy Spirit <I>(v3)</I>. But they did not seek Him earnestly <I>(5:15)</I>. Their goodness [&nbsp;&atilde;&ntilde;Y&ccedil;Y <I>chesed</I>] quickly evaporated <I>(v4)</I>. All the Lord required was mercy [again &atilde;&ntilde;Y&ccedil;Y <I>chesed</I>, i.e. mercy = goodness] <I>(v6, Micah 6:8)</I>. But they broke the covenant <I>(v7)</I> and went into captivity.<H3><P>

Israel to return to the Lord
</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;But in the lands of their dispersion, Israel would be <B>redeemed</B> and <B>return to the Lord</B>. &ldquo;I will <B>save the house of Joseph</B>, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have <B>mercy</B> upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> <B>their God</B>, and will hear them. ... Their heart shall rejoice in the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL>. I will ... gather them; for I have <B>redeemed</B> them: and they shall increase as they have increased [to become a fulness of gentile nations]. And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember Me <B>in far countries</B>&rdquo; <I>(Zechariah 10:6&ndash;9)</I>.<H3><P>

Jesus Israel&rsquo;s Messiah
</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Who hath believed our report [that the House of Israel have become Christians]? and to whom is the arm of the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> revealed [in redeeming His people]? ... Surely He [Messiah] hath borne <B>our</B> [Israel&rsquo;s] griefs, and carried <B>our</B> sorrows: yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But He was wounded for <B>our</B> transgressions, He was bruised for <B>our</B> iniquities: the chastisement of <B>our</B> peace was upon Him; and with His stripes <B>we</B> are healed. All we like <B>sheep</B> have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all&rdquo; <I>(Isaiah 53:1&ndash;6)</I>.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>After two days will He revive us: in the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live in His sight</B>&rdquo; <I>(v2)</I>. Their resurrection in three days pointed to the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and to His being Israel&rsquo;s <B>Messiah</B>. All the prophets testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow <I>(1&nbsp;Peter 1:10&ndash;11)</I>. Messiah would die to <B>redeem Israel</B> <I>(Luke 1:68)</I> and to <B>save the world</B> <I>(John 3:16)</I>.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;But we trusted that it had been He which should have <B>redeemed Israel</B>: and ... today is the <B>third day</B> since these things were done. ... Then He said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe <B>all that the prophets have spoken</B>: Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into His glory? And beginning at Moses and <B>all the prophets<I>,</I> </B>He expounded unto them <B>in all the scriptures</B> the things concerning <B>Himself</B>&rdquo; <I>(Luke 24:21&ndash;27)</I>. Jesus must have quoted this verse from Hosea!<H3><P>

The Jews reject Jesus
</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<B>Also</B>,<B> O Judah</B>,<B> He hath set an harvest</B> [of reckoning] <B>for thee</B>,<B> when I</B> [shall] <B>return the captivity of My people</B>&rdquo; <I>(v11)</I>. The captivity of &ldquo;My people <B>Israel</B>&rdquo; was turned by Messiah&rsquo;s atoning death upon the cross, His Resurrection and Ascension, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, so that they became a <B>redeemed</B> Christian people. The Jews (remnant of Judah) reaped the harvest of their unbelief. &ldquo;Therefore I say unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you [Jews], and given to a nation [Israel] bringing forth the fruits thereof&rdquo; <I>(Matthew 21:43)</I>. &ldquo;Behold your house is left unto you desolate&rdquo; <I>(Matthew 23:38)</I>. Jerusalem was destroyed in <SMALL>AD</SMALL> 70.<H3><P>

Jews who were not of Judah
</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp;Jesus told the unbelieving Jews that they were not His sheep <I>(John 10:26)</I>, that Abraham was not their father <I>(John 8:39)</I>. When the Jews returned from Babylon in 534<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL>  many had married foreigners. In the following centuries there was a further substantial influx of non-Israelitish people. &ldquo;Many people of the land became Jews&rdquo; <I>(Esther 8:17)</I>. Then in 125<SMALL>&nbsp;BC</SMALL> the Idumeans (Edomites, descendants of Esau) were forcibly incorporated into Jewry by John Hyrcanus. These false Jews, &ldquo;which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan&rdquo; <I>(Revelation 2:9, 3:9, see also John 8:44, 1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:15&ndash;16)</I>, were the bitter enemies of Christ.<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp;In <SMALL>AD&nbsp;</SMALL>740 the Khazar king made Judaism the state religion of his empire; the Khazar empire flourished for five centuries in eastern Europe. It is estimated that 90 per cent of today&rsquo;s Jews are Ashkenazim&mdash; descended from the Khazars, and therefore not Semitic peoples.
